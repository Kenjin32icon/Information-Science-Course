### **SECTION A: COMPULSORY**

#### **QUESTION ONE**

**a) Distinctions:**

- **Informetrics vs. Bibliometrics**: Informetrics analyzes all forms of information, while bibliometrics focuses on written documents like research articles.
- **Scientometrics vs. Librametrics**: Scientometrics studies scientific research trends and impact, while librametrics examines library operations and usage.
- **Webometrics vs. Altmetrics**: Webometrics evaluates web-based materials (e.g., website rankings), while altmetrics measures online research engagement (e.g., social media shares).

**b) Limitations of Bibliometrics:**  
Bibliometrics is biased by discipline, language, and database coverage. It overemphasizes quantity, allows citation manipulation, and has a time lag in measuring impact. For example, non-indexed journals or recent publications are often overlooked.

**c) Zipf's Law in Bibliometrics:**  
Zipf's Law states that word frequency is inversely proportional to rank. It identifies keywords, core journals, and citation patterns in bibliometrics, such as analyzing common terms in research fields.

### **SECTION B: CHOOSE ANY TWO QUESTIONS**

#### **QUESTION TWO**

**a) Social Network Measures:**

- **Distance**: Shortest path between two nodes, showing closeness in networks.
- **Density**: Ratio of actual to possible connections, indicating network cohesion.
- **Centrality**: Importance of a node in the network (e.g., hubs in research).

**b) Benefits of Social Network Analysis:**  
Reveals influential researchers, collaboration patterns, and interdisciplinary trends. It also identifies isolated researchers, tracks institutional partnerships, and measures the quality of collaborations.

#### **QUESTION THREE**

**a) Indicators in Bibliometrics:**  
Indicators are quantitative tools for assessing research productivity, quality, and impact, such as citation counts or the h-index.

**b) Common Indicators:**

- **h-Index**: Balances productivity and impact.
- **Total Publications**: Measures research volume.
- **Citations per Publication**: Shows article visibility and influence.
