- **Meaning of Entrepreneurship**: The definition of entrepreneurship can be explored from different perspectives including economic, sociological, and psychological viewpoints. Entrepreneurship is a multidimensional concept with no single definition. An entrepreneur is someone who pays a certain price for a product to resell it at an uncertain price and makes decisions about obtaining and using resources.
- **Role in Economic and Social Development:** Entrepreneurship is vital for economic development as it contributes to innovativeness, product improvement, and reduction of unemployment. It also leads to job creation, investment, and contributes to the gross national product. Socially, entrepreneurship can improve living conditions, education, and social status.
- **Social Entrepreneurship:** Social entrepreneurship is a form of entrepreneurship that focuses on making a difference and using business principles to help society. It involves innovation and ideas for social change, rather than purely for profit. Examples include the Grameen Bank and TOMS.
- **Corporate Entrepreneurship:** This refers to the development of new ideas and opportunities within large or established businesses, leading to improved profitability and competitiveness. It involves encouraging innovation and risk-taking within existing companies.
