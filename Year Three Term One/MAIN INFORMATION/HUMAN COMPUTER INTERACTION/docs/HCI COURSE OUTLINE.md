**ALLQ 3214: COMPUTER INTERACTIONS AND INFORMATION SECURITY**

**Lecture** **H****o****urs:** **39**

**Purpose****:**

The course introduces students to the theory and applications of human computer interaction (HCI). Students should achieve an understanding of human perception and psychology related to HCI, concepts and methods of interactive systems as well as information security concepts and threats. It demonstrates an understanding of the design of interfaces that facilitates the use of computers and other personal electronic devices such as handheld devices. Theory and practice of usability is emphasized. This course also provides an introduction to the various technical and administrative aspects of information security and assurance. This course provides the foundation for understanding the key issues associated with protecting information assets, determining the levels of protection and response to security incidents, and designing a consistent, reasonable information security system, with appropriate intrusion detection and reporting features

**Learning Outcomes:**

At the end of this course unit, the learner should be able to:

- Appreciate the importance of the user interface in software development.
    
- Understand key aspects of human psychology which can determine user actions at and satisfaction of the interface.
    
- Describe the key design principles for user interfaces.
    
- Set up and carry out a process to gather requirements for, engage in iterative design of, and evaluate the usability of a user interface.
    
- Identify key design errors in simple interfaces and suggest alternative designs.
    
- Discuss ethical issues involved in testing user interfaces.
    
- Define information security and outline its major components.
    
- Identify the major types of threats to information security and the associated attacks.
    
- Develop strategies to protect organization information assets from common attacks.
    
- Understand how security policies, standards and practices are developed
    
- Understand the role of management in enforcing security policies, standards and practices.
