### Week 2 audio:- ![[Note Narration Audio/note_-_Mar_27_2025_10:20.mp3]]

This week provides an introduction to the critical aspects of how humans interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the fundamental characteristics of GUIs, their historical development, and various interpretations of this interaction.

**Overview on Human-Graphical User Interface Interaction**

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers. A primary goal of HCI is **to improve the interactions between users and computers by making computers more usable and receptive to the user's needs**.

When users interact with a computer system via a GUI, they do so through a **user interface (UI)**, which is the part of the computer and its software that people can see, hear, touch, talk to, or otherwise understand or direct. For users, the interface often _is_ the system.

Interaction with a GUI typically involves:

- **Input:** How a person communicates needs to the computer, often through devices like a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen. Actions are usually performed through **direct manipulation of graphical elements**.
- **Output:** How the computer conveys results to the user, primarily through the display screen, using graphics, widgets, and text.

The interaction follows a cycle of user actions and system responses, where the user forms a goal, intends an action, specifies and executes it, perceives and interprets the system state, and evaluates the outcome.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a **type of user interface using graphics for interaction with a computer**. It employs **graphical images, widgets, along with text to represent the information and actions available to a user**.

**Key Features of a Today's GUI:**

- **Pointer:** A symbol (usually an arrow or I-beam) that appears on the display screen and is moved to select objects and commands.
- **Pointing Device:** A device like a mouse or trackball that enables you to select objects on the screen.
- **Icons:** Small pictures that represent commands, files, or windows. Users can execute commands or open windows by interacting with icons. Icons are a **principal feature of graphical user interfaces**.
- **Desktop:** The area on the display screen where icons are grouped, intended to represent real objects on a real desktop. This utilizes the **desktop metaphor**.
- **Windows:** Divisible areas of the screen in which different programs or files can be run or displayed. Windows can be moved and resized.
- **Menus:** Lists of commands from which users can select to execute actions. Menu bars typically appear under the application title bar. Pull-down, pop-up, and cascading menus are common.
- **Widgets (Controls):** Graphical objects like buttons, text boxes, scroll bars, and lists that allow users to interact with the application. These can be categorized into Input, Output, Selection, and Action elements.
- **Direct Manipulation:** Actions are usually performed by directly manipulating graphical elements with a pointing device.

**Advantages of GUI:**

- **Easier to use:** Well-designed GUIs can free the user from learning complex command languages.
- **Faster learning:** Symbols are recognized faster than text.
- **More natural:** Exploits visual/spatial cues.
- **Provides context:** Continuous visibility of objects and actions.
- **Reduces memory requirements:** Relies on recognition rather than recall.
- **Predictable system responses:** Immediate feedback.
- **Less anxiety concerning use:** Encourages exploration.
- **More attractive:** Visual appeal.
- **Supports multitasking:** Multiple programs can run simultaneously.
- **Platform independent (Standard GUI):** Aims for consistency across different systems.

**Disadvantages of GUI:**

- **Greater design complexity:** Requires careful consideration of visual elements and interaction.
- **Learning still necessary:** Users need to learn the specific GUI elements and their functions.
- **Can be inefficient for expert users:** May be slower than command-line interfaces for repetitive tasks.
- **Increased chances of clutter and confusion:** Poor design can lead to overwhelming visual information.
- **May consume more screen space:** Graphical elements can take up more space than text commands.
- **Hardware limitations:** Performance can be affected by CPU power and memory.

**Evolution of Graphical User Interface**

The development of GUIs represents a significant shift in how humans interact with computers.

- **Pre-1970s:** Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) were the dominant form of interaction, requiring users to type commands.
- **1970s:** The first operational GUI was developed at **Xerox PARC** with the **Alto** computer (around 1973). Key features included a 3-button mouse, bit-mapped display, and graphical windows.
- **1981:** Xerox introduced the **Star**, the commercial successor to the Alto, featuring double-clickable icons, overlapping windows, and dialog boxes. It emphasized the **object-action syntax**.
- **1983:** Apple introduced the **Lisa**, which brought pull-down menus and menu bars. Visi Corp released Visi On, the first integrated graphical software environment for IBM PCs.
- **1984:** Apple launched the **Macintosh**, which popularized the GUI with a focus on ease of use and the **WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) interface**.
- **Late 1980s - 1990s:** Microsoft Windows gained prominence, bringing GUIs to a wider audience on IBM PCs. The **Web User Interface** emerged with the growth of the internet.
- **Today:** GUIs are the standard for most programs and operating systems. The **desktop metaphor** is widely used. User-centered design principles guide the development of increasingly intuitive and accessible GUIs.

**Interpretations on Human-Graphical User Interaction**

Understanding how to design effective GUIs involves adhering to certain principles and concepts.

- **User-Centered Design (UCD):** A design philosophy where the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. Key principles include active user involvement, appropriate function allocation, iterative design, and multidisciplinary teams.
- **Usability:** The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
- **Learnability:** The ease with which new users can begin effective interaction.
- **Flexibility:** The multiplicity of ways the user and system exchange information.
- **Robustness:** The level of support provided to the user in determining successful achievement and assessment of goals.
- **Golden Rules of GUI Design (Shneiderman):** A set of eight principles for good interface design:
    1. Strive for consistency.
    2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.
    3. Offer informative feedback.
    4. Design dialogs to yield closure.
    5. Offer error prevention and simple error handling.
    6. Permit easy reversal of actions.
    7. Support internal locus of control.
    8. Reduce short-term memory load.
- **Norman's 7 Principles:** Focus on making things understandable and usable.
- **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:** Broad guidelines for evaluating user interface design.
- **Visual Communication Principles:** Organization, economy, and communication.
- **Direct vs. Indirect Manipulation:** Interacting directly with on-screen objects vs. using commands or menus.

Effective GUI design aims to create a **transparent interface**, where users can focus on their tasks without being hindered by the mechanics of the interface. Consistency, feedback, error prevention, and user control are crucial elements in achieving this goal.
