### Week 3: Designing Websites (Features of a Good Website)

**I. Core Principles of Website Design**

- **User-Centered Approach**: Good website design should be driven by **business requirements and the needs of the users** rather than just the latest technology.
- **Clear Goals**: Website development must begin with a clear definition of the siteâ€™s **purpose**, including both **primary goals** (e.g., selling products) and **secondary goals** (e.g., conveying a specific brand image).
- **Target Audience**: It's essential to understand the **target audience** to tailor content and presentation effectively.
- **Usability**: Websites should be **easy to use** and navigate, particularly for first-time users. If a site is not usable, it is unlikely that visitors will return.
- **Credibility and Trust**: Web designers need to build trust with users by ensuring that the content is credible, as users may skip the rest of a page if they do not believe what they have already read.

**II. Analyzing Overall Site Aims**

- **Defining the Site's Purpose**: The first step is to define the site's purpose by starting with a broad idea and refining it.
- **Detailing Goals**: Goals should be detailed by asking "What are we trying to achieve?" and adding specific details to the description.
- **Implicit Messages**: Consider the messages a potential customer might receive from the site, both positive and negative.
- **Primary vs. Secondary Goals**: Identify primary goals (e.g., a catalogue of goods) and secondary goals (e.g., using colors to suggest stability).
- **Brainstorming**: Use brainstorming techniques to generate ideas about the site's purpose.
- **Business Requirements**: Understanding the business requirements and the expected audience is crucial for understanding the site requirements and design.

**III. Website Architecture**

- **Logical Structure**: Focus on how the pages are **organized logically** rather than physically on the disk.
- **Navigation Paths**: Consider the preferred paths users might follow and the paths provided to make the structure truly hypertext.
- **Information Architecture**: Develop an information architecture which is an abstract view of how a site is organized.
- **Web Page Architecture**: Design the structure of individual pages before settling on the layout and style.
- **Page Elements**: Focus on the structure of page elements, and then the 'look and feel' can be added using HTML, JavaScript, and so on.

**IV. Navigation Planning**

- **Importance of Navigation**: Navigation is a critical aspect of website design.
- **Storyboarding**: Use storyboarding to document and analyze the tasks users might undertake.
- **Navigational Aids**: Include navigational aids within the page architecture.
- **Preventing "Lost in Hyperspace"**: Overcome the problem of users getting lost by ensuring every page includes:
    - **Where you are**: Show the user their current location.
    - **Where you have been**: Show the user where they have come from.
    - **Where you can go**: Show the user available navigation options.

**V. Designing for Hyper-Reading**

- **Non-Linear Reading**: Recognize that users can read hypertext documents non-linearly.
- **Implicit Ordering**: Consider the implicit ordering of a page architecture.
- **Dynamic Content**: Be aware that dynamic content can influence how a user reads a page.

**VI. Website File Structure**

- **Organized Components**: Organize files into separate folders for reusable components.
- **Assets Folder**: Create an "Assets" folder for GIF buttons, icons, JavaScript programs, PDF documents, and photographs.

**VII. HTML and Website Design**

- **HTML Structure:** Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document is essential for good website design.
    - HTML pages are created by tagging textual information with HTML markup. HTML markup consists of tags, which appear inside angled brackets `<` and `>`.
    - Most HTML tags have a corresponding end tag, which is specified by the name of the tag preceded by the `/` character.
    - HTML documents have a basic structure that includes the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **HTML Formatting:** Various HTML tags can be used to format HTML elements.
    - `<b>` makes text bold, while `<i>` makes it italic.
    - `<a>` creates hyperlinks, and `<p>` tags are used for paragraphs.
- **HTML Validation:** Ensure that HTML code is valid by using online validators.
    - Online validation services check HTML documents for compliance with HTML standards.

**VIII. Style Sheets and Website Design**

- **Consistency**: Style sheets (or templates) can provide consistency when formatting text across multiple web pages.
- **Maintainability**: Style sheets make websites easier to maintain because changes to formatting can be made by modifying just one document.
- **CSS**: Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control the presentation of web pages.
    - CSS is a collection of rules that describe the format of HTML tags.
    - CSS can be used to control things like font styles, margins, text alignment, background colors, and text colors.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Be aware that style sheets may be displayed slightly differently on different browsers.

**IX. Usability in Internet Commerce**

- **First-Time User Experience**: A website should be easily understood by first-time users.
- **Guided Navigation**: A site needs to guide the visitor through the transformations in the DAGMAR model in an easy and confident manner.
- **Product Browsing**: Provide a well-considered way for users to browse and search product lists.
- **Enquiry Mechanisms**: Websites should provide a mechanism for users to enquire about products on offer, such as email for a virtual shop attendant.
- **Repeat Customers**: Provide functionality for repeat customers such as saved purchase history and saved customer details.
