### **Programming Examples of I/O Instructions**

Here are some examples of assembly programs that demonstrate how I/O instructions are used to interact with input and output devices. These examples are based on the concepts of Input/Output (I/O) instructions such as `IN`, `OUT`, and memory-mapped I/O operations. These examples assume a generic architecture, so the exact syntax may vary based on the specific assembly language or processor architecture (e.g., x86, ARM, MIPS).

#### **Example 1: Simple Input/Output Loop (Polling)**

This example demonstrates reading an input from a port (keyboard, button press) and displaying it on an output port (LED or display).

```assembly
; Program to read data from input port and send it to output port

START:
    IN R0, 0x60        ; Read data from input port 0x60 into register R0
    CMP R0, #0         ; Compare the input data with zero (check if input is available)
    BEQ START          ; If input is zero (no data), continue polling
    OUT R0, 0x70       ; Send the contents of R0 to output port 0x70
    JMP START          ; Jump back to START to keep checking input
```

**Explanation**:

- The program continuously reads from input port `0x60`.
- It compares the data with `0`. If no input data is available (i.e., `R0 = 0`), it keeps polling the input port.
- Once data is available, it is sent to the output port `0x70`.
- The program then returns to checking the input continuously.

#### **Example 2: Memory-Mapped I/O**

This example demonstrates memory-mapped I/O where special memory locations are mapped to I/O devices.

```assembly
; Program to read data from a memory-mapped I/O device and write to another

START:
    MOV R0, [0x3000]   ; Load data from memory address 0x3000 (I/O device register) into R0
    CMP R0, #0         ; Compare the data with zero (check if input is available)
    BEQ END            ; If no input, jump to END
    MOV [0x4000], R0   ; Write data in R0 to memory address 0x4000 (output device)
    JMP START          ; Continue reading and writing

END:
    RET                ; Return from program
```

**Explanation**:

- `0x3000` is a memory-mapped address that corresponds to the input device's register.
- The program loads the data from the memory-mapped I/O location into register `R0`.
- If the data is non-zero, it is written to the output device at address `0x4000`.
- This approach uses memory-mapped I/O where addresses correspond directly to device registers.

#### **Example 3: Keyboard Input and LED Output**

This example shows how a program could read user input from a keyboard (assuming an I/O port) and then light up an LED based on the input.

```assembly
; Program to read a key press from the keyboard and turn on the LED if 'A' is pressed

START:
    IN R0, 0x60       ; Read data from keyboard input port (0x60) into R0
    CMP R0, #'A'      ; Compare input with character 'A'
    BEQ TURN_ON_LED   ; If 'A' is pressed, jump to turn on the LED
    CMP R0, #'B'      ; Else, compare with 'B'
    BEQ TURN_OFF_LED  ; If 'B' is pressed, jump to turn off the LED
    JMP START         ; Continue polling the keyboard

TURN_ON_LED:
    OUT 0x70, #1      ; Turn on LED by sending value 1 to output port 0x70
    JMP START         ; Go back to polling for new input

TURN_OFF_LED:
    OUT 0x70, #0      ; Turn off LED by sending value 0 to output port 0x70
    JMP START         ; Go back to polling for new input
```

**Explanation**:

- The program continuously reads from the keyboard input port `0x60`.
- If the user presses the key corresponding to `'A'`, the program turns on an LED by sending `1` to output port `0x70`.
- If the key `'B'` is pressed, the LED is turned off by sending `0` to the same output port.
- This loop runs indefinitely until the program is interrupted or halted.

#### **Example 4: Interrupt-Driven I/O**

In this example, we demonstrate the use of an interrupt to handle I/O operations, such as when data becomes available from a sensor or user input.

```assembly
; Program to handle input using interrupt (Interrupt 0x10)

START:
    ; Main program loop
    NOP               ; Do nothing, just waiting for the interrupt
    JMP START         ; Loop infinitely until interrupt occurs

INTERRUPT_HANDLER:
    IN R0, 0x60       ; Read input data from the device (keyboard or sensor) into R0
    OUT 0x70, R0      ; Output the data to port 0x70 (display or LED)
    RETI              ; Return from interrupt and resume program
```

**Explanation**:

- The program enters a loop, doing nothing (`NOP`), until an interrupt occurs.
- When an interrupt is triggered (e.g., when input data becomes available), the `INTERRUPT_HANDLER` routine is executed.
- The handler reads data from the input port `0x60` and writes it to the output port `0x70`.
- After handling the interrupt, it returns to the main program using `RETI` (Return from Interrupt), which resumes the main program execution.

#### **Example 5: Direct Memory Access (DMA) for Efficient I/O**

DMA allows peripherals to directly transfer data to and from memory without involving the CPU. Below is a simplified version of how DMA might be triggered:

```assembly
; Program to initiate DMA for reading from I/O device to memory

START:
    ; Set up DMA to read data from I/O device to memory
    MOV DMA_CTRL, #1  ; Enable DMA channel 1 (activate DMA)
    MOV DMA_ADDR, 0x3000  ; Set DMA source address (I/O device register)
    MOV DMA_DEST, 0x5000  ; Set DMA destination address (memory)
    MOV DMA_LEN, #256  ; Set DMA length (256 bytes)

    ; Wait for DMA transfer to complete
    WAIT_FOR_DMA:
        CMP DMA_STATUS, #0   ; Check if DMA has completed
        BEQ WAIT_FOR_DMA     ; If not, keep waiting

    ; DMA transfer complete, process the data
    MOV R0, [0x5000]   ; Load data from memory (destination) into R0
    RET                 ; Return from program
```

**Explanation**:

- The program sets up the DMA controller to transfer data from the I/O device (at memory address `0x3000`) to memory (at address `0x5000`).
- The DMA transfer length is set to 256 bytes.
- The program then waits for the DMA transfer to complete by checking the `DMA_STATUS` register.
- Once completed, the data is available at the destination memory location, and it is processed.

### **Conclusion**

These programming examples illustrate various ways I/O instructions are used in assembly language programming. The examples cover polling, memory-mapped I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, and DMA. Each method has its use cases, with polling being simpler but less efficient, interrupts allowing asynchronous handling, and DMA enabling high-speed, CPU-free data transfer. These basic I/O techniques are fundamental in system-level programming, especially for embedded systems and low-level device control.
