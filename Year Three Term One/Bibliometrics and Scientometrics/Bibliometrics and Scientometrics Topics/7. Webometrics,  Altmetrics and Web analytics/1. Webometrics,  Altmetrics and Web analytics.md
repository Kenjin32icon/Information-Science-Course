### **[[webometrics]]**

- **ranks universities worldwide every six months since 2004** based on a composite indicator that considers both **the volume of web content and the visibility and impact of web publications**.
- The **ranking aims to promote academic web presence and encourage open access initiatives to increase the transfer of scientific and cultural knowledge to society.** It specifically aims to **improve the presence of academic and research institutions on the web and promote the open-access publication of scientific results**.
- The **ranking is not designed to evaluate websites, their design or usability, or the popularity of their content.**
- The Webometrics score is calculated based on four factors:
    - **Presence** accounts for 20% of the score and is calculated based on the total number of web pages in all formats on the website.
    - **Impact** accounts for 50% of the score and is measured using backlinks the website receives from other websites external to the university.
    - **Openness** accounts for 15% of the score and measures the number of documents published in the institutional repository, with a current focus on recent publications (from 2007).
    - **Excellence** accounts for 15% and counts the articles published in high-impact international journals.
- **Limitations:**
    - **Focus on size** (number of pages) favors large, old universities with many staff members.
    - **Complications arise due to the affiliations of mobile academics**.
    - **Susceptibility to manipulation**, such as creating websites solely for generating in-links.
    - **Frequent changes in methodology**.

### **[[Altmetrics]]**

- Short for **"alternative metrics," Altmetrics recognizes that scholarly conversations occur in daily interactions, primarily online**.
- **Conventional metrics and approaches often overlook these significant online conversations.**
- **Altmetrics measure the following:**
    - **Attention**- the number of people exposed to and engaged with scholarly work.
    - **Dissemination**- the locations and reasons for discussions and sharing of research, both within academia and the public sphere.
    - **Influence and Impact**- digital footprints, digital shadows, digital reputation, and impact on peers and society.
- **Interactions considered by Altmetrics include:**
    - Article downloads
    - Article views
    - Article sharing
    - Tagging
    - Following
    - Tweeting and retweeting
- **Advantages of Altmetrics over traditional metrics**:
    - **Quicker**
    - **Inclusive**
    - **Flexible**
- **Altmetrics does not aim to replace traditional metrics; it provides complementary perspectives**.

### **[[Web Analytics]]**

- **involves analyzing visitor behavior on a website** and is frequently used as part of customer relationship management analytics.
- **This analysis might include monitoring customer actions within the website, such as identifying the websites from which customers most frequently arrive**.
- **Web Analytics can be utilized for several purposes, including:**
    - **Evaluating the possibility of a customer making a repeat purchase after a previous purchase**.
    - **Personalizing the website for frequent visitors**.
    - **Tracking the monetary value of purchases made by individual customers or specific customer groups**.
    - **Observing the geographical regions with the highest and lowest customer visits and product purchases**.
    - **Predicting the products customers are most and least likely to buy in the future**.
- **The main objective is to promote products to customers who are most likely to purchase them and determine a specific customer's most likely purchases**.
- **Web Analytics approaches encompass:**
    - Web server log analysis
    - Page tagging
    - Geolocation of visitors based on IP
    - Click analytics
    - Customer lifecycle analytics
    - Packet sniffing
    - Hybrid approaches

The document provides a comprehensive overview of three web data analysis methods: Webometrics, Altmetrics, and Web Analytics. While Webometrics focuses on ranking universities based on web presence and impact, Altmetrics explores alternative ways to measure scholarly impact through online interactions. Web Analytics delves into analyzing user behavior on websites for marketing and customer relationship management purposes. Each method offers unique insights into web data and serves distinct objectives in understanding online presence, scholarly influence, and user behavior.
