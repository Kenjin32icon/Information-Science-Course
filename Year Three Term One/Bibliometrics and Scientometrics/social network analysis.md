# Introduction to Social Network Analysis (SNA)

## Definition of Social Network Analysis (SNA)
Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a methodological approach aimed at investigating social structures through the lens of networks. As defined by Otte and Rousseau (2002), SNA involves the mapping and measurement of relationships and flows between various entities, including individuals, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information or knowledge entities. In this framework, the entities are referred to as "nodes," which represent the people and groups within the network.

## Key Concepts in SNA

1. **Sociogram**:  
    A sociogram is a visual representation of a social network that delineates the connections among nodes. It provides a graphical depiction of relationships, helping to clarify the structure and dynamics of the network.
    
2. **Size**:  
    The size of a network refers to the number of actors (nodes) present in either a complete or egocentric network. This measure is essential for understanding the scale and potential complexity of interactions within the network.
    
3. **Distance**:  
    Distance is defined as the number of "steps" or connections required to link any two actors in the network. This concept is crucial for analyzing the degree of separation and the potential flow of information between individuals.
    
4. **Node**:  
    In SNA, a node represents an entity within the social network, which can be an individual, group, or organization.
    
5. **Density**:  
    Density measures the connectivity within a network, calculated by dividing the number of connections a participant has by the total number of possible connections. A higher density indicates a more interconnected network.
    
6. **Centrality**:  
    Centrality assesses the extent to which an individual interacts with others in the network. Individuals with high centrality are often seen as influential or important due to their numerous connections.
    

## Types of Social Networks

1. **Egocentric Networks**:  
    These networks focus on the individual and study the personal network surrounding that individual, examining how these connections affect their behavior and experiences.
    
2. **Sociocentric Networks**:  
    Sociocentric networks concentrate on larger groups of people, quantifying relationships within the group and analyzing patterns of interaction and their effects on the group as a whole.
    

## Metrics in Social Network Analysis

### Connections

- **Homophily**:  
    This metric measures the tendency of actors to form ties with similar individuals rather than dissimilar ones.
    
- **Multiplexity**:  
    Multiplexity refers to the number of different types of relationships contained within a tie. For instance, if two individuals are both friends and colleagues, their multiplexity would be 2.
    
- **Mutuality/Reciprocity**:  
    This metric assesses the extent to which two actors reciprocate each other's interactions, such as friendship.
    

### Distributions

- **Bridge**:  
    A bridge is an individual whose weak ties connect two otherwise disconnected clusters or individuals, filling a structural hole in the network.
    
- **Centrality**:  
    Centrality indicates the importance or influence of a node within the network.
    
- **Density**:  
    Density, in this context, is the proportion of direct ties relative to the total number of possible ties in the network.
    
- **Distance**:  
    Distance measures the minimum number of ties required to connect two specific actors.
    
- **Structural Holes**:  
    Structural holes refer to the absence of ties between two parts of a network, which can create opportunities for individuals who can bridge these gaps.
    
- **Tie Strength**:  
    Tie strength is defined by a combination of factors such as time, emotional intensity, intimacy, and reciprocity. Strong ties are often characterized by homophily, closeness, and transitivity, while weak ties are associated with bridging connections.
    

### Segmentation

- **Cliques and Social Circles**:  
    Groups are identified as cliques if every individual is directly connected to every other individual. Social circles have less direct connectivity.
    
- **Clustering Coefficient**:  
    This measure indicates the likelihood that two associates of a node are also associates themselves. A higher clustering coefficient suggests a greater degree of interconnectedness or "cliquishness."
    
- **Cohesion**:  
    Cohesion refers to the degree to which actors are directly connected to one another within the network.
    

## Applications of Social Network Analysis

SNA has a wide range of applications across various fields, including:

- **Friendship and Acquaintance Networks**: Understanding social relationships and dynamics.
- **Collaboration Networks**: Analyzing partnerships and teamwork in professional settings.
- **Kinship and Relationships**: Studying family ties and social structures.
- **Disease Transmission**: Investigating how diseases spread through social connections.
- **Customer Interaction Analysis**: Examining consumer behavior and interactions.
- **Marketing**: Utilizing network insights for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Business Intelligence**: Leveraging network data
