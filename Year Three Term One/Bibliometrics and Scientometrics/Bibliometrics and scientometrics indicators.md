# Definitions of Indicators
• [[Bibliometric indicators]] are quantitative tools used to measure and evaluate research. They focus on:

- **Comparison**: Assessing the quantity, quality, and visibility of research produced by individuals or institutions.
- **Measurement Goals**: Gauging research output, impact, and visibility to provide insights into academic performance and influence.

# Purpose of bibliometric 
The purpose of bibliometric indicators is to quantify and evaluate various aspects of scientific research, including:

- **Production, Use, and Impact**: Measuring the output, usage, and influence of scientific publications.
- **Research Excellence**: Assessing the performance of individual researchers, teams, and institutions.
- **National Contributions**: Evaluating the research contributions and impact of countries.

# Types of Indicators
[[Direct indicators]] – these are indicators which are objective and are found directly on the documents (e.g. number of publications).
[[Derived indicators]] – these are calculated based on an analysis of documents (e.g. citations).
[[Assigned indicators]] – based on external assessments e.g. peer judgment, reputation.

# Publication count 

[[Publication Count]] is a bibliometric indicator used to measure and analyze research output. Key aspects include:

- **Quantity of Output**: Total number of publications, indexed works, and papers in high-impact journals.
- **Distribution**: Publications categorized by channels (local, regional, international) and fields of study.
- **Relative Indices**:
    - **Relative Activity Index**: Compares a unit's share of publications in a specific field to its overall share of publications.
    - **Relative Specialization Index**: Measures focus in a specific field, with values ranging from -1 (no activity) to 1 (complete specialization).

# Citations
[[Citations]] are key bibliometric indicators for assessing research impact. They include:

- **Basic Metrics**:
    
    - Total number of citations and citations per publication.
    - **Normalized Citation Score**: Compares a unit's citation count to the global average.
    - **Hirsch (h) Index**: Measures productivity and citation impact.
    - Self-citations and uncitedness (publications with no citations).
- **Advanced Metrics**:
    
    - **Average Percentile**: Indicates the relative citation ranking of publications within similar types and fields.
    - **Top 5% Metric**: Percentage of publications among the top 5% most cited globally in their category.
- **Analytical Techniques**:
    
    - **Co-citation Analysis**: Tracks how often two papers are cited together in the same article or patent.
    - **Co-word Analysis**: Examines the frequency of specific keywords appearing together in literature or patents.

# Collaboration
Collaboration metrics in bibliometrics measure the extent and nature of cooperative research efforts. These include:

- **Co-authorship**: The involvement of multiple authors in a publication.
- **Authors per Publication**: Average number of contributors per work.
- **Affiliations per Publication**: Number of institutions collaborating on a single publication.
- **Cross-Country Collaboration**: Number of countries represented in a publication.
- **Interdisciplinary Research**: Number of fields or disciplines covered in a publication.
- **Program Collaboration**: Co-delivery of academic or research programs.
- **Collaborative Research**: Joint efforts in conducting and publishing studies.

# Journal Factors

1. **Impact Factor**: Measures the average number of citations a publication in a specific journal receives in the two years after its publication.
    
2. **Normalized Journal Impact**: Compares the number of citations to publications in a particular journal with the global average for publications of the same document type, age, and subject area. It provides a relative measure of the journal's impact.
