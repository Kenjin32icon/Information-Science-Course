# What is [[bibliometrics]] ?
This is a field of study which uses mathematical and statistical analysis techniques to study publishing and communication patterns in the distribution of information .

# Bibliometrics vs. Informetrics
[[informetrics]] deal with analyzing the patterns in the production and use of any form of information. Bibliometrics deal with published information.
Thus, bibliometrics can be considered as a subset of informetrics.
# What is Scientometrics?
[[scientometrics]] applies bibliometric approaches to science (physical and natural sciences excluding social sciences).
Scientometrics also goes beyond the usual realms of bibliometrics e.g. when it considers the politics or development of science.
Policies on scientific research at all levels also  fall within the ambit of scientometrics.

==Note:- Scientometrics is confined; bibliometrics is wide while informetrics is overall.==

# Descriptive vs. Evaluative Metrics
 [[Descriptive metrics]] deal with comparing research output in a specific field, including production in different countries, time periods, subdivisions of the field, or a combination of these factors.
While [[Evaluative metrics]]  deals with evaluate scientific publications' quality and impact, focusing on scientific activity and performance quality. They are often determined by counting references from numerous research workers.

# Historical Background
The concept of bibliometrics, was formally named by Allan Pritchard in 1969 as "the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication," has historical roots dating back to 1896. Key milestones include:

- **1896**: Campbell's statistical study on subject scattering in publications.
- **1917**: Cole and Eales analyzed the growth of literature in comparative anatomy (1550–1860) using bibliographical citations.
- **1923**: Hulme suggested counting publications to track the development of science and technology.
- **1948**: Ranganathan introduced "[[librametry]]" as a precursor to bibliometrics.

These developments laid the foundation for the formalization of bibliometrics.

# Foundations
The foundations of bibliometrics rest on the premise that most research findings are disseminated through academic journal articles, which are read and cited by other researchers. Key points include:

- **Citation Impact**: The number of citations an article receives is viewed as a measure of its impact.
- **Measurement Scope**: Bibliometrics evaluates the volume of published articles, their citation frequency, and the relationships among articles, authors, and subjects.
- **Growing Significance**: Despite some lack of consensus, bibliometrics is increasingly recognized as a vital tool in the research landscape.

# Sources of Bibliometrics Data

	– Arts and Humanities Citation Index
• Pub-Med/Medline
• Scopus
• Google Scholar
• Institutional repositories

# Application
The applications of bibliometrics include diverse uses in evaluating and analyzing research and information production, such as:

- **Institutional Rankings**: Assessing universities and departments based on their scientific output.
- **Publication Evaluation**: Analyzing the quality and usage of publications and information resources.
- **Information Flow**: Studying factors that influence the production, distribution, and utilization of information.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying patterns in research themes and knowledge consumption.

## Additional applications involve:

- Assessing the impact and effectiveness of information services.
- Quantitative analysis of academic literature.
- Highlighting areas of research strengths and weaknesses.
- Recognizing leading researchers and top scientific journals.

# Limitations of Bibliometrics
Bibliometrics has several limitations that affect its accuracy and reliability:

- **Disciplinary Variations**: Citation patterns vary significantly across disciplines, with fields like arts, humanities, and social sciences relying less on journal publications.
- **Citation Context**: Citations may reflect criticism rather than support, yet they are still counted equally.
- **Data Coverage**: Bibliometric tools often exclude certain research areas and publications, leading to inconsistent results.
- **System Manipulation**: Practices like self-citation, mutual citations among colleagues, and fragmenting research into multiple articles can distort bibliometric data.
