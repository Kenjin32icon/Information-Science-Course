### Week 2: The Internet and the Web

**I. Introduction to the Internet and the Web**

- The **Internet** and the **World Wide Web** are technologies that have rapidly evolved and been accepted by companies and consumers, despite being rooted in academic and altruistic endeavors.
- The Internet celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2009, while the Web had been in existence for over 15 years.
- Commercial interests currently drive much of the technological development of both.

**II. Hypertext: The Foundation of the Web**

- **Hypertext** is a system that allows for non-sequential or non-linear reading. It is the underlying idea behind the Web.
- Hypertext systems link information so that readers can access it directly without having to read a document from beginning to end.
- Hypertext documents are multidimensional and allow for different reading paths.
- **Anchors and Links**: A hypertext document contains links referring to other parts of the document, or even to other documents.
    - **Hyperlinks** are embedded links in a document that allow users to jump to another part of the same page, another page in the same document, or another document.
    - **Anchors** are fragments of information that link to another document or portion thereof. They are the visual representation of a link, while a link is the actual reference to the other document.
- **Knowledge Additivity**: Hypertext can connect different aspects of information from different fields of study, making the information more useful.
- **Hypermedia** is an extension of hypertext that includes digitized sounds and moving images.

**III. The World Wide Web**

- The **World Wide Web** (Web) is a **hypermedia system** that is accessible over the internet. It is a large digital library.
- The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in October 1994.
- The Web has become a general communications mechanism, with applications in many different fields.
- **Global Reach**: Web servers and clients can be located anywhere in the world, connected by telecommunication links. The Web has no single geographical location.
- **Universal Access**: There is potentially universal access to an enormous volume of documents over the Internet. However, access is poor in some developing countries.
- **Fields of Application:**
    - **Dissemination of Knowledge**: Chat rooms, bulletin boards, and FAQs facilitate the sharing of information.
    - **Education**: The Web is used for open or distance learning programs.
    - **Online Trading**: Business transactions are carried out on the Web.
- The Web gives rise to copyright issues, makes purchasing easier, and provides a sense of place despite the irrelevance of distance.

**IV. Web Terminologies**

- **Network Protocols**: Standard ways of regulating data transmission between computers.
    - **TCP/IP (Transaction Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** is a dominant protocol.
- **Web Application (Webapp)**: A software application accessed over a network using a web browser.
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**: A format that specifies the location of 'documents' on the Web, providing a straightforward mechanism for locating Web documents.
- **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)**: The language used to create web pages.
    - HTML is a markup language that uses tags to format text and other content.
- **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: The protocol used to transfer information on the Web.
    - HTTP is not mandatory for distributed hypertext, but it is ubiquitous. HTTP servers can supply information of every possible data type using extensible MIME-types. HTTP allows request-response cycles of less than 100 milliseconds.

**V. Client-Server Computing Model**

- The client-server model involves distributing the load of information and processing.
- **Clients (Web Browsers)** request information from servers.
- **Servers (Web Servers)** respond to client requests by sending information such as HTML documents, images, and other files.
- Information is passed from the server to the browser, which may include HTML documents, GIF files, Excel spreadsheets, movies, and other digital content.

**VI. Navigation and "Hyperspace"**

- The ease of linking information can create hypertext documents that are difficult to use, leading to users getting 'lost in hyperspace'.
- Techniques to minimize the risk of getting lost:
    - **Return Path**: Backtracking through previous documents.
    - **Home Page**: The starting fragment in a path, which provides initial links and helps to remind users of their navigation path.
    - **Overview Diagrams**: Site-maps that show the network of documents and links.
    - **Guided Tours**: Suggested paths arranged by document authors.
    - **Direct Jumps**: Moving directly to a portion of a document using a URL.
    - **Content-Based Retrieval**: Using a search facility to narrow the information space.

**VII. Security on the Web**

- Data transmitted over the web needs to arrive intact (integrity), be prevented from being seen by others (confidentiality), be genuine (authentication), and have non-repudiation.
- Encryption algorithms have made integrity and confidentiality feasible.

These notes provide a comprehensive overview of the key concepts related to the Internet and the Web, suitable for a second week of study. They should clarify the technologies, terminologies, and ideas that form the foundation of the Web and its use.
