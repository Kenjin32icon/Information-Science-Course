## CAT 1

Course:  Web Design

Admission Number: AIIM/00477/2021

Name: Lewis Kariuki

Questions:

### a) Using appropriate examples, discuss any FOUR factors to consider while seeking a website host. (8 marks)

1. Performance and speed:

The performance of the host has a direct impact on how fast the user might access the website. Annoying are slow openings in it since users experience nonestopping fast browsing with some jump-off rates. The search engines such as Google rank websites based on load times to their higher search results. Some crucial attributes are:

I. Server speed- Seek out hosts that use optimized servers for fast performance such as those with SSD (Solid-State Drives) storage instead of the conventional HDD (Hard Disk Drives)- For such have much higher read and writing speeds using data form.

ii. Content Delivery Network: A content delivery network distributes your website's content all over several servers in the world to be fast enough to access for any of your visitor's locations.

      III. Uptime guarantees: Host that has strong uptime records, like 99.9% or even more, provides continuity in your website being always available to users without showing any hiccup.

An excellent example of such a host is SiteGround which has gained fame for having wonderful performance, optimized speed and great uptimes.

2. Security Types

Security is the core factor in rendering your website secured from threats, i.e. hacking and data breaching, along with malware. Insecurity leads to attacking websites and diluting user and website data. Some of the security features are:

1. SSL Certificates: Those who ensure that your host offers SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates which encrypt the data sent from the user's browser to the server.

      II. Backup Solutions: Those automatic backups which offer recovery after loss of data or hacking, such as a Cloud Backup Server.

III. Firewalls and Malware protection: Host with a wide range of solid security features such as firewalls and DDoS protection, among other malware-scan features.

For example, WP Engine is such managed WordPress hosts that focus on the security aspects and provide such security as backup creation, SSL certificates, and daily scanning for malware.

3.  Customer Service

Reliable customer service is also significant, especially concerning cases when you experience a technical problem and need assistance in managing your website. You do not want to stay for hours or even days to give you a solution to a problem that can impact the operation of your site. The next features would improve the customer support under:

I. Support 24/7: The host is supposed to have customer support operational day and night and should have diverse outreach mediums like live chatting online, telephone assistance, and e-mail.

Consumers will need expert staff to provide assistance with certain problems ranging from server configuration work, website software use, and general troubleshooting for any type of error.

Quality of support: Check out reviews and testimonials to see whether customers are satisfied with responsiveness and knowledge of the support team.

Bluehost is one example of a very good customer support service. Highly regarded for support, it is basically live with knowledgeable staff 24/7 and has a broad base of extensive knowledge bases/tutorials.

### Scalability

Your growing site may require you to adjust your hosting solutions to embrace the increased demand on the network and host resources. Good web host companies have flexible options on scalability where you are to upgrade easily without having to transfer your business to another host. Here are the benefits that will help boost scalability:

I. Varied plans: Find out whether the host provides multiple options for hosting, including shared plans, VPS hosting, and dedicated servers. This way, if your website traffic and resources increase, you will still be able to scale up.

ii. Allocating resources: Make sure the hosting provider allows scaling of parameters off storage and bandwidth with easy and little downtime.

iii. Simple migration: Ensure you opt for a web host with the ability to promote you to a better plan, or to transfer provisions out to another server without much hassle.

An example of a platform that provides more scalability will be Hostgator: it offers all kinds of hosting applications from shared hosting for newbies to VPS and dedicated servers for big sites, and easily scales along with developing the business with its hosted models.

### b) Explain any FOUR properties of a good web site. (8 marks)

#### **1. Usability (User-Friendliness)**

Usability considers how pleasantly and instinctively users handle your website, and once they find it difficult to make sense of anything, they will pack their bags and never return.

- Look for it:

Intuitive navigation: labels on menus, links, or buttons should be self-explanatory as users should clearly be able to search for what they would like in a couple of clicks.

Calls to Action: Have a clear and easily understood call-to-action buttons, like quite a few others, to encourage the user to act on "buy now," "contact us," or "learn more."

It should be easy to use on all types of devices for example desktops, tablets, and mobiles, neither needing zooming or horizontal scrolling.

Example: Apple's site is a reference site for usability; it has simple navigation, products are easy to find, CTAs are clear and in place, and the design adapts.

#### **2. Fast Load Times**

Fast, good-quality website opens because speed is directly related to how much a user is satisfied with and retained by a website. A site that takes time to load would irritate visitors and has huge bounce rates, thus hindering its search engine ranking.

• What to Look For:

Optimized images: heavy files will reduce page load speed; thus, it needs to be compressed into very minimal quality loss.

Very few heavy scripts: Too few JavaScript and CSS files on a webpage would increase the time to load. For example, lazy loading, which loads content only when it is accessed, improves speeds.

Robust server and hosting: excellent hosting provider that performs well will also ensure a fast load.

• An Example: Google stands a very good example in the fast loading time. It has millions of contents, but despite its optimized techniques, it under a second.

#### **3. Mobile Friendliness (Responsive Design)**

Each passing day increases the population of wireless users, and so has the need to make sites mobile friendly. It means that the design should automatically fit the screen size and device.

- What to check for:

Responsive layout: will automatically adapt to the size of those screens on which it will be viewed, and offer automatic resizing and repositioning of text, images, buttons, etc.

Touch-friendly design: , as people tap their fingers on the site, the interactive elements in it should be given right size dimensionally so that they may be tappable with minimum necessary contact, whether it's the button or the link.

Fast Performance on mobile: Optimized for mobile that will avoid long loading times at delay, especially through mobile data connections.

- Example: Amazon mobile website provides great mobile experience because it has a responsive design that adapts the product images and descriptions for small screens and the navigation is designed for touch.

#### **4. Trivial Content**

Content is the very blood that keeps every site alive. That is why it should be compellingly clear and informative enough for visitors to see beyond the purchase or activity they are convinced to perform, such as signing up for a newsletter. Pure blood.

• What You Should Know About It:

Relevant and quality content: Text, images, and videos would need to be relevant to the audience and add value to them, besides having grammatically correct, well-informative, and error-free content.

Under-Informative: Do not overwhelm the user by blasting too much information over one event. Keep the information short and sweet to allow for an easy scan, such as by headings and bullets.

Consistency of Tone The tone of the articles should be related to the purpose of the website and the audience that the site tries to address; it has to remain uniform across the entire site.

• Example: National Geographic website is a good example of effective content. It involves high-quality informational articles coupled with fascinating images-all these sprites organized under a simple segmentation easy for a reader to navigate.

### c) Describe the process to follow when posting a website online. (8 marks)

#### **1. Creation of the Website**

Web Design: You design the website, which includes creating the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, and other assets. Tools such as Adobe XD, Figma, or other web design software can be used in the design phase.

Develop the Website: If the design is ready, you should start coding. You will develop all structures, styles, and behavior appearances on the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript respectively.

Test Local: It will be amazing if you test the website locally on your computer before uploading it. Just open the files in a browser and check how everything works.

#### **2. Domain name**

A domain name refers to the URL address that viewers would use to reach your website; for example, www.example.com.

A domain can be acquired using domain sellers such as go daddy, name cheap or google domains. Choose a domain suiting your brand or content.

#### **3. Choose Web Hosting.**

Web Hosting: This is a service that hosts your website files and makes them accessible in electronic form. It may be as follows:

        ◦ Shared Hosting: Websites share the same server resources. This is usually the cheapest option.

    ◦ VPS (Virtual Private Server): This one has a little bit more punch where you have dedicated resources from a server but at a bit higher price range.

    ◦ Dedicated Hosting: An entire server is your own where you can get complete power and control over the same.

Cloud Hosting: Websites are hosted on cloud infrastructure, offering scalability and uptime.

    • Popular among web hosting providers are Bluehost, SiteGround, HostGator, and DigitalOcean.

#### **4. Transfer Your Website Files**

FTP or File Transfer Protocol, to transfer your files over the Internet to the server, use an FTP client, such as FileZilla, and get your user name-password-server address FTP credentials from your hosting provider.

cPanel: Most hostings include cPanel, that is, a web-based control panel, which can be used to upload files from the web interface.

File Management Systems: Some hosting providers provide their web-based file managers to upload files easily.

#### **5. Connect domain and hosting**

Configure Domain DNS Settings: After buying, connect your domain with a hosting service provider. For this purpose, you will update the DNS settings of the Domain Name System.

Log in to your domain registrar account and locate the DNS settings.

Configure the nameservers supplied by your hosting provider so that the domain points to your web host.

#### **6. Test the Website**

Upload the files and set up the domain, now try and view online your website by simply typing the domain name in the browser, www.example.com for instance.

Ensure that all pages, links, and functionalities are in working order.

#### **7. Publish and Maintain**

Your site is live! Everything works; however, the story does not end here: ◦ Backup: Configure regular backs up of your website to prevent data loss. ◦ SEO: Make your site's search engine optimization (SEO) more visible. ◦ Update Content: the content and design of your website to keep them fresh on a regular basis.

Performance Monitoring: Google Analytics is used to calculate the visits and the performance as well.

### d) Explain any THREE trends in Web application. (6 marks)

#### **1. Progressive Web Applications**

PWAs are the web applications, to experiences like a native mobile application, but created through standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These apps are intended to be fast, reliable, and engaging. They can work offline, receive push notifications, and load pages with very low speed.Action also exists for all user devices that use the app and can be added to the home screen without an app store.

PWAs take the best both of the web and mobile worlds together. They are fast, available offline, and do not need to develop for multiple platforms. Companies, therefore, can give a better user experience by using fewer resources.

Examples include Twitter Lite, Pinterest, and Flipboard.

#### **2. Single Page Applications**

SPAs, or single-page applications, are web applications that load only once, and after that, it keeps changing the page using dynamic data when the user interacts with the application. Instead of reloading complete web pages, load just data that are being interacted with in making seamless user experience as well as speedier.

SPAs take advantage of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to allow data to be retrieved from the server without the need to reload complete pages, thus giving the experience of speed, like a desktop application, via APIs.

SPAs provide a smooth, fast user experience and better performance and faster loading times as a result. This is highly relevant to the server load aspect as it reduces the strain on servers, which is very important for a good number of mobile users using slower internet connections.

Examples include Gmail, Google Maps, and Facebook.

#### **3. Serverless Architecture**

Serverless means a paradigm where developers could build and run web applications without having to deal with the underlying infrastructure. The server-side logic will be handled by cloud providers like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and developers will have to focus on writing code without bothering about the servers.

Serverless architecture should allow a developer to write an event-driven function to handle, say, an HTTP request, which would then automatically scale without writing another line of code. Pay only for compute time, automatically scale, and cost savings build more.

It allows developers to find one place where they write all the logic for the application while using that time and investment saving servers, scaling, and maintenance. This model can be highly scalable and cost-effective for applications with unpredictable and fluctuating traffic.

Serverless functions are also used by APIs that run in cloud hosting, as well as other backend services and third-party integrations.
