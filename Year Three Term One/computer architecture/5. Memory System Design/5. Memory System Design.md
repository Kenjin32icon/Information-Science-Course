## What does Memory System Design  entail
Memory System Design focuses on creating a **memory hierarchy** that combines the speed of fast memory with the cost-effectiveness of slower memory. This is achieved by organizing memory in levels, with the fastest and smallest level (**cache**) at the top, followed by the larger and slower **main memory**, and then the even slower and larger **secondary storage** (disk) and **tertiary storage** (tape). The objective is for the memory system to perform as fast as the fastest unit while costing as much as the slowest unit.

### Key concepts in Memory System Design include:

- **Locality of reference:** Programs tend to access the same or nearby memory locations repeatedly. **Spatial locality** refers to accessing nearby addresses, while **temporal locality** refers to accessing the same address multiple times.
    
- **Cache mapping:** Determining where to place incoming main memory blocks in the cache. Techniques include **direct mapping** (simple, but inefficient), **associative mapping** (efficient, but complex), and **set-associative mapping** (a compromise between the two).
    
- **Replacement techniques:** Deciding which cache block to replace when the cache is full. Options include **random replacement**, **first-in-first-out (FIFO)**, and **least recently used (LRU)**.
    
- **Cache write policies:** Ensuring data consistency between the cache and main memory. **Write-through** updates both simultaneously, while **write-back** updates the main memory only when a block is replaced.
    
- **Virtual memory:** Utilizing secondary storage to expand the apparent size of main memory. **Pages** are moved between disk and main memory based on demand.
    
- **Page replacement algorithms:** Similar to cache replacement, but for pages in main memory. Common algorithms include **random**, **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **clock replacement**.
    
- **Segmentation:** Dividing memory into variable-sized **segments** for program relocation and protection.
    
- **Paged segmentation:** Combining paging and segmentation for efficient memory management.
    
- **Read-only memory (ROM):** Non-volatile memory for storing permanent data, with various types like **[[mask-programmed ROM]]**, **[[PROM]]**, **[[EPROM]]**, **[[FEPROM]]**, and **[[EEPROM]]**.
    



## Distinction between  [[Memory System Design I]] and [[Memory System Design II]]
### **[[Memory System Design I]]**
primarily focuses on the design and analysis of **cache memory**, the first level in the memory hierarchy. It delves into concepts like:

- **Memory hierarchy** principles
- **Locality of reference** (spatial and temporal) and its impact on performance
- **Cache mapping techniques** (direct, associative, set-associative) and their trade-offs
- **Replacement techniques** for managing cache blocks (random, FIFO, LRU)
- **Cache write policies** (write-through, write-back) for data consistency

### **[[Memory System Design II]]**
expands on these concepts and covers additional levels of the memory hierarchy, particularly **main memory** and **virtual memory**. It explores topics like:

- **Main memory organization** using static and dynamic RAM cells
- **Virtual memory design** principles and its role in extending memory capacity
- **Address translation techniques** (direct, associative, set-associative) for virtual memory
- **Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)** for improving virtual address translation speed
- **Page replacement algorithms** (random, FIFO, LRU, clock) for managing main memory pages
- **Segmentation** and **paged segmentation** for memory organization and protection
- **Read-only memory (ROM)** types and characteristics

Essentially, **Memory System Design I establishes the foundation by focusing on cache memory, while Memory System Design II builds upon it by encompassing main memory and virtual memory concepts.**
