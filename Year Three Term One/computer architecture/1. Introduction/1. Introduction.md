### 4. Disk-shaped computer chip with ideal switching components:

Given the assumption that a switching component (like a transistor) can switch in zero time, and that electronic signals travel at 300,000 kilometers per second, let’s determine the limitations on chip diameter.

- **Clock rate of 1 GHz (1 billion Hz):**  
    The time for one cycle at 1 GHz is 1 ns1 \text{ ns}. At a speed of 300,000 km/s, the maximum distance a signal can travel in 1 ns is 300 kilometers. Thus, the diameter of the chip must be less than 300 kilometers.
    
- **Clock rate of 1 THz (1 trillion Hz):**  
    For 1 THz, the cycle time is 1 picosecond (1 ps = 10−12 seconds10^{-12} \text{ seconds}). In this time, the signal can travel only about 0.3 micrometers, meaning the chip diameter must be smaller than this, making such a chip impractical.
    

**Conclusion:**  
A chip operating at 1 THz is not feasible with current technology, as the size of the chip required for practical signal travel exceeds limits.

### 5. Compare uniprocessor systems with multiprocessor systems in the following aspects:

**(a) Ease of programming:**  
Uniprocessor systems are simpler to program because there is only one processor. Multiprocessor systems can be more complex to program due to issues like parallelism and data synchronization.

**(b) The need for synchronization:**  
Multiprocessor systems require more synchronization to manage multiple processors accessing shared resources, while uniprocessor systems have no such concern.

**(c) Performance evaluation:**  
Multiprocessor systems can potentially offer higher performance, but this depends on efficient load balancing and communication between processors. Uniprocessor systems may have lower overall performance but are easier to evaluate.

**(d) Run time system:**  
Multiprocessor systems need advanced runtime systems to handle communication and task scheduling between processors, while uniprocessor systems have simpler runtime environments.

### 6. Consider having a program that runs in 50 s on computer A with a 500 MHz clock. What clock rate must machine B have to run the same program in 20 s, given that machine B requires 2.5 times as many clock cycles?

**Given:**

- Program execution time on A = 50 seconds.
- Clock rate of A = 500 MHz.
- Execution time on B = 20 seconds.
- Machine B requires 2.5 times more cycles than A.

**Solution:**

Let CAC_A be the number of cycles on A and CBC_B the cycles on B.  
Since time = cycles / clock rate, we have:  
CA=50×500×106=25×109C_A = 50 \times 500 \times 10^6 = 25 \times 10^9 cycles.

For B:  
CB=2.5×CA=2.5×25×109=62.5×109C_B = 2.5 \times C_A = 2.5 \times 25 \times 10^9 = 62.5 \times 10^9.

Now, the clock rate of B is:  
Clock rate of B=CBTime on B=62.5×10920=3.125×109=3125 MHz\text{Clock rate of B} = \frac{C_B}{\text{Time on B}} = \frac{62.5 \times 10^9}{20} = 3.125 \times 10^9 = 3125 \text{ MHz}.

**Answer:** The clock rate of machine B should be 3125 MHz.

### 7. Compare machine A with clock cycle time 50 ns and CPI 4.0 and machine B with clock cycle time 65 ns and CPI 2.5. Which machine is faster?

**Solution:**

- For machine A:  
    Time per instruction = 50 ns×4.0=200 ns50 \text{ ns} \times 4.0 = 200 \text{ ns}.
    
- For machine B:  
    Time per instruction = 65 ns×2.5=162.5 ns65 \text{ ns} \times 2.5 = 162.5 \text{ ns}.
    

**Answer:** Machine B is faster because its time per instruction is less (162.5 ns vs. 200 ns).

### 8. A compiler designer is trying to decide between two code sequences for a particular machine. The hardware designers have supplied the following facts:
instruction class       CPI of the instruction class
A                           1
B                           3
C                           4
For a particular high-level language, the compiler writer is considering two sequences that require the following instruction counts:


                            Instruction counts(in millions)
   Code sequence                   A       B       C
		1                               2       1       2
		2                               4       3       1



To compare the two code sequences, we can calculate the **total cycles per instruction (CPI)** for each code sequence based on the instruction counts and the cycles per instruction (CPI) for each instruction class.

The formula to calculate the total cycles for each code sequence is:

Total cycles=(Instruction count of A×CPI of A)+(Instruction count of B×CPI of B)+(Instruction count of C×CPI of C)\text{Total cycles} = (\text{Instruction count of A} \times \text{CPI of A}) + (\text{Instruction count of B} \times \text{CPI of B}) + (\text{Instruction count of C} \times \text{CPI of C})

Let's calculate the total cycles for both code sequences.

### Code Sequence 1:

For Code Sequence 1:

- A: 2 million instructions, CPI = 1
- B: 1 million instructions, CPI = 3
- C: 2 million instructions, CPI = 4

Total cycles for sequence 1=(2×1)+(1×3)+(2×4)\text{Total cycles for sequence 1} = (2 \times 1) + (1 \times 3) + (2 \times 4) Total cycles for sequence 1=2+3+8=13 million cycles\text{Total cycles for sequence 1} = 2 + 3 + 8 = 13 \text{ million cycles}

### Code Sequence 2:

For Code Sequence 2:

- A: 4 million instructions, CPI = 1
- B: 3 million instructions, CPI = 3
- C: 1 million instructions, CPI = 4

Total cycles for sequence 2=(4×1)+(3×3)+(1×4)\text{Total cycles for sequence 2} = (4 \times 1) + (3 \times 3) + (1 \times 4) Total cycles for sequence 2=4+9+4=17 million cycles\text{Total cycles for sequence 2} = 4 + 9 + 4 = 17 \text{ million cycles}

### Conclusion:

- **Code Sequence 1** requires **13 million cycles**.
- **Code Sequence 2** requires **17 million cycles**.

 Thus, **Code Sequence 1** is more efficient in terms of the total number of cycles needed.

### 9Consider a machine with three instruction classes and CPI measurements as follows:
instruction class       CPI of the instruction class
A                           2
B                           5
C                           7
Suppose that we measured the code for a given program in two different compilers and obtained the following data:


                            Instruction counts(in millions)
Code sequence                   A       B       C
Compiler 1                      2       1       2
Compiler 2                      4       3       1

Assume that the machine’s clock rate is 500 MHz. Which code sequence will
execute faster according to MIPS? And according to execution time?

. Which code sequence is faster, according to MIPS and execution time, for a machine with a clock rate of 500 MHz?

Calculate the execution time and MIPS for both compiler-generated sequences and determine the faster one.

To compare the two compilers (Code sequences from Compiler 1 and Compiler 2) based on **MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)** and **execution time**, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the **total execution time** for each compiler.

The **execution time** is determined by the formula:

Execution Time=Total CyclesClock Rate\text{Execution Time} = \frac{\text{Total Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}

Where the total cycles can be calculated as:

Total Cycles=(Instruction count of A×CPI of A)+(Instruction count of B×CPI of B)+(Instruction count of C×CPI of C)\text{Total Cycles} = (\text{Instruction count of A} \times \text{CPI of A}) + (\text{Instruction count of B} \times \text{CPI of B}) + (\text{Instruction count of C} \times \text{CPI of C})

The clock rate is given as **500 MHz**, which means **500 million cycles per second** (500 × 10^6 cycles/sec).

### Step 2: Calculate the **total cycles** for each compiler.

#### For Compiler 1:

- A: 2 million instructions, CPI = 2
- B: 1 million instructions, CPI = 5
- C: 2 million instructions, CPI = 7

Total cycles for Compiler 1=(2×2)+(1×5)+(2×7)=4+5+14=23 million cycles\text{Total cycles for Compiler 1} = (2 \times 2) + (1 \times 5) + (2 \times 7) = 4 + 5 + 14 = 23 \text{ million cycles}

#### For Compiler 2:

- A: 4 million instructions, CPI = 2
- B: 3 million instructions, CPI = 5
- C: 1 million instructions, CPI = 7

Total cycles for Compiler 2=(4×2)+(3×5)+(1×7)=8+15+7=30 million cycles\text{Total cycles for Compiler 2} = (4 \times 2) + (3 \times 5) + (1 \times 7) = 8 + 15 + 7 = 30 \text{ million cycles}

### Step 3: Calculate **execution time** for each compiler.

Now, we can calculate the execution time using the clock rate of 500 MHz.

#### For Compiler 1:

Execution Time for Compiler 1=23 million cycles500 million cycles/sec=0.046 seconds\text{Execution Time for Compiler 1} = \frac{23 \text{ million cycles}}{500 \text{ million cycles/sec}} = 0.046 \text{ seconds}

#### For Compiler 2:

Execution Time for Compiler 2=30 million cycles500 million cycles/sec=0.06 seconds\text{Execution Time for Compiler 2} = \frac{30 \text{ million cycles}}{500 \text{ million cycles/sec}} = 0.06 \text{ seconds}

### Step 4: Calculate **MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)** for each compiler.

MIPS is calculated by the formula:

MIPS=Instruction Count (in millions)Execution Time (in seconds)\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Instruction Count (in millions)}}{\text{Execution Time (in seconds)}}

#### For Compiler 1:

The total number of instructions is:

Total instructions for Compiler 1=2+1+2=5 million instructions\text{Total instructions for Compiler 1} = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \text{ million instructions}

The MIPS for Compiler 1 is:

MIPS for Compiler 1=5 million instructions0.046 seconds≈108.7 MIPS\text{MIPS for Compiler 1} = \frac{5 \text{ million instructions}}{0.046 \text{ seconds}} \approx 108.7 \text{ MIPS}

#### For Compiler 2:

The total number of instructions is:

Total instructions for Compiler 2=4+3+1=8 million instructions\text{Total instructions for Compiler 2} = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 \text{ million instructions}

The MIPS for Compiler 2 is:

MIPS for Compiler 2=8 million instructions0.06 seconds≈133.33 MIPS\text{MIPS for Compiler 2} = \frac{8 \text{ million instructions}}{0.06 \text{ seconds}} \approx 133.33 \text{ MIPS}

### Step 5: Compare results

- **Execution Time:**
    - **Compiler 1**: 0.046 seconds
    - **Compiler 2**: 0.06 seconds

**Compiler 1** executes faster because it has a shorter execution time.

- **MIPS:**
    - **Compiler 1**: 108.7 MIPS
    - **Compiler 2**: 133.33 MIPS

**Compiler 2** has a higher MIPS rate, meaning it executes more instructions per second. However, **MIPS is not always a reliable indicator of overall performance** because it does not account for the number of cycles taken by each instruction.

### Conclusion:

- **Execution Time**: **Compiler 1** will execute faster because it has a lower execution time.
- **MIPS**: **Compiler 2** has a higher MIPS value, but this does not mean it is faster in terms of actual execution time.

### Three enhancements with the following speedups are proposed for a new machine: Speedup(a) 1⁄4 30, Speedup(b) 1⁄4 20, and Speedup(c) 1⁄4 15.
Assume that for some set of programs, the fraction of use is 25% for
enhancement (a), 30% for enhancement (b), and 45% for enhancement (c).
If only one enhancement can be implemented, which should be chosen to
maximize the speedup? If two enhancements can be implemented, which

Based on Amdahl’s Law, calculate the maximum speedup for each combination of enhancements and choose the optimal one.
