**[[PURPOSE OF THE COURSE (HCI)]]**

This course teaches students to design user interfaces based on the capabilities of computer technology and the needs of human factors. Students design a user interface for a system and implement a prototype from a list of informal requirements. The project is developed over three assignments by a design process based on current human–computer interaction principles.

**[[EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES from (HCI)]]**

Upon completion of the course, Students will be able to:

a) Explain the capabilities of both humans and computers from the viewpoint of human information processing.

b) Describe typical human–computer interaction (HCI) models, styles, and various historic HCI paradigms.

c) Apply an interactive design process and universal design principles to designing HCI systems.

d) Describe and use HCI design principles, standards and guidelines.

e) Analyze and identify user models, user support, socio-organizational issues, and stakeholder requirements of HCI systems.

f) Discuss tasks and dialogs of relevant HCI systems based on task analysis and dialog design.

g) Analyze and discuss HCI issues in groupware, ubiquitous computing, virtual reality, multimedia, and Word Wide Web-related environments.
