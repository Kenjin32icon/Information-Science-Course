### 3. Find the meaning of the following:

**(a) Cluster computing:**  
Cluster computing refers to the use of multiple connected computers (nodes) that work together as a single system to solve complex computational tasks more efficiently.

**(b) Grid computing:**  
Grid computing is a form of distributed computing where resources (like processing power or storage) from multiple locations are combined to solve large problems.

**(c) Quantum computing:**  
Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum bits (qubits) and quantum phenomena, like superposition and entanglement, to perform computations that would be difficult or impossible for classical computers.

### 4. Disk-shaped computer chip with ideal switching components:

Given the assumption that a switching component (like a transistor) can switch in zero time, and that electronic signals travel at 300,000 kilometers per second, let’s determine the limitations on chip diameter.

- **Clock rate of 1 GHz (1 billion Hz):**  
    The time for one cycle at 1 GHz is 1 ns1 \text{ ns}. At a speed of 300,000 km/s, the maximum distance a signal can travel in 1 ns is 300 kilometers. Thus, the diameter of the chip must be less than 300 kilometers.
    
- **Clock rate of 1 THz (1 trillion Hz):**  
    For 1 THz, the cycle time is 1 picosecond (1 ps = 10−12 seconds10^{-12} \text{ seconds}). In this time, the signal can travel only about 0.3 micrometers, meaning the chip diameter must be smaller than this, making such a chip impractical.
    

**Conclusion:**  
A chip operating at 1 THz is not feasible with current technology, as the size of the chip required for practical signal travel exceeds limits.

### 5. Compare uniprocessor systems with multiprocessor systems in the following aspects:

**(a) Ease of programming:**  
Uniprocessor systems are simpler to program because there is only one processor. Multiprocessor systems can be more complex to program due to issues like parallelism and data synchronization.

**(b) The need for synchronization:**  
Multiprocessor systems require more synchronization to manage multiple processors accessing shared resources, while uniprocessor systems have no such concern.

**(c) Performance evaluation:**  
Multiprocessor systems can potentially offer higher performance, but this depends on efficient load balancing and communication between processors. Uniprocessor systems may have lower overall performance but are easier to evaluate.

**(d) Run time system:**  
Multiprocessor systems need advanced runtime systems to handle communication and task scheduling between processors, while uniprocessor systems have simpler runtime environments.

### 6. Consider having a program that runs in 50 s on computer A with a 500 MHz clock. What clock rate must machine B have to run the same program in 20 s, given that machine B requires 2.5 times as many clock cycles?

**Given:**

- Program execution time on A = 50 seconds.
- Clock rate of A = 500 MHz.
- Execution time on B = 20 seconds.
- Machine B requires 2.5 times more cycles than A.

**Solution:**

Let CAC_A be the number of cycles on A and CBC_B the cycles on B.  
Since time = cycles / clock rate, we have:  
CA=50×500×106=25×109C_A = 50 \times 500 \times 10^6 = 25 \times 10^9 cycles.

For B:  
CB=2.5×CA=2.5×25×109=62.5×109C_B = 2.5 \times C_A = 2.5 \times 25 \times 10^9 = 62.5 \times 10^9.

Now, the clock rate of B is:  
Clock rate of B=CBTime on B=62.5×10920=3.125×109=3125 MHz\text{Clock rate of B} = \frac{C_B}{\text{Time on B}} = \frac{62.5 \times 10^9}{20} = 3.125 \times 10^9 = 3125 \text{ MHz}.

**Answer:** The clock rate of machine B should be 3125 MHz.

### 7. Compare machine A with clock cycle time 50 ns and CPI 4.0 and machine B with clock cycle time 65 ns and CPI 2.5. Which machine is faster?

**Solution:**

- For machine A:  
    Time per instruction = 50 ns×4.0=200 ns50 \text{ ns} \times 4.0 = 200 \text{ ns}.
    
- For machine B:  
    Time per instruction = 65 ns×2.5=162.5 ns65 \text{ ns} \times 2.5 = 162.5 \text{ ns}.
    

**Answer:** Machine B is faster because its time per instruction is less (162.5 ns vs. 200 ns).
