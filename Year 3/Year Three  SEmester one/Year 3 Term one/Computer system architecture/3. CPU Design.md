## **Exercises**

### **1. Number of Instruction Bits:**

#### (a) Two operand registers and one result register in a machine that has 64 general-purpose registers

- To specify a register in a machine with 64 general-purpose registers, we need 6 bits (since log⁡264=6\log_2 64 = 6).
- For two operand registers and one result register, the total number of bits required would be: 6 (bits for operand 1)+6 (bits for operand 2)+6 (bits for result register)=18 bits6 \, \text{(bits for operand 1)} + 6 \, \text{(bits for operand 2)} + 6 \, \text{(bits for result register)} = 18 \, \text{bits}

#### (b) Three memory addresses in a machine with 64 KB of main memory

- To address 64 KB of memory, we need 16 bits (since log⁡265536=16\log_2 65536 = 16).
- For three memory addresses, the total number of bits required would be: 16 (bits for address 1)+16 (bits for address 2)+16 (bits for address 3)=48 bits16 \, \text{(bits for address 1)} + 16 \, \text{(bits for address 2)} + 16 \, \text{(bits for address 3)} = 48 \, \text{bits}

### **2. Micro-Operations of Load, Store, and Jump Instructions**

#### (a) **One-bus system**

In a one-bus system, all data transfers (including reading and writing to/from memory, and between registers) use a single bus.

- **Load**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction (address from PC to IR).
    2. Read memory (from address in IR to memory bus).
    3. Transfer data from memory bus to register.
- **Store**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction (address from PC to IR).
    2. Move data from register to memory bus.
    3. Write data from memory bus to memory.
- **Jump**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction (address from PC to IR).
    2. Set the Program Counter (PC) to the address from IR (PC = IR).

#### (b) **Two-bus system**

In a two-bus system, one bus can be used to read from memory while the other bus can be used to write to memory or transfer between registers.

- **Load**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction.
    2. Read memory (memory address to memory bus).
    3. Transfer data from memory bus to register bus.
- **Store**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction.
    2. Write data from register to memory bus.
    3. Transfer data from memory bus to memory.
- **Jump**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction.
    2. Set the PC to the address from the instruction.

#### (c) **Three-bus system**

In a three-bus system, three separate buses can handle data movement, allowing greater parallelism.

- **Load**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction.
    2. Read memory (from memory to memory bus 1).
    3. Transfer data from memory bus 1 to register bus.
- **Store**:
    
    1. Fetch the instruction.
    2. Transfer data from register to memory bus 2.
    3. Write data from memory bus 2 to memory.

### **3. Add Control Signals to Tables in Section 5.4**

This question requires you to add the appropriate control signals to tables in a textbook or lecture material (which is not provided here). Typically, control signals are needed for data transfer operations like loading, storing, reading, writing, and setting control registers (such as PC, IR, MAR). You'll need to analyze the specific micro-operations and add the necessary signals to ensure the proper control flow for each operation.

---

### **4. Data Movement Methods**

#### (a) **Dedicated Connections**:

- **Advantages**: High speed, no need for bus arbitration, efficient for specialized tasks.
- **Disadvantages**: Inflexible (cannot be reused for other tasks), more wiring required.

#### (b) **One-bus Datapath**:

- **Advantages**: Simple design, cheaper, fewer components.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower due to bus contention (only one device can use the bus at a time), potential bottleneck.

#### (c) **Two-bus Datapath**:

- **Advantages**: Increased parallelism, faster than one-bus system since two devices can operate simultaneously.
- **Disadvantages**: More complex than a one-bus system, requires additional control.

#### (d) **Three-bus Datapath**:

- **Advantages**: Maximum parallelism, fastest performance (three devices can operate simultaneously).
- **Disadvantages**: Most complex design, highest hardware cost.

---

### **5. Microinstruction Encoding**

To minimize the number of control bits while preserving inherent parallelism, we can group the control signals that are activated together.

- **I1**: a, b, c, d, e
- **I2**: a, d, f, g
- **I3**: b, h
- **I4**: c
- **I5**: c, e, g, i
- **I6**: a, h, j

You could encode these into binary, identifying the common control signals across microinstructions and sharing bits where possible. The actual encoding depends on the specifics of your system's control structure.

---

### **6. Hardwired and Microprogramming Control Approaches**

#### (a) **Hardwired Approach**:

##### (i) **Boolean expressions** for each control line:

For each control line (A through G), you would write Boolean expressions based on the activations in the table for each instruction step.

##### (ii) **Logic Circuit for Each Control Line**:

For example, if a control line is activated by steps T0 and T2, then the Boolean expression might be something like: A=(T0 and D) or (T2 and G)A = (T0 \, \text{and} \, D) \, \text{or} \, (T2 \, \text{and} \, G)

Then, you would create a circuit that implements this expression using logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).

#### (b) **Microprogramming Approach**:

##### (i) **Horizontal Representation**:

In horizontal microprogramming, each microinstruction specifies multiple control lines. You would write down the microprogram for `Inst-1` by specifying the control signals activated for each time step.

##### (ii) **Best Grouping and Microinstruction Size**:

With both horizontal and vertical representations, the control signals can be grouped to minimize redundancy. This reduces the size of each microinstruction. Horizontal representation would have one large microinstruction per step, while vertical would use smaller microinstructions with fewer control bits but more steps.

---

### **7. Control Fields in Microinstructions**

#### (a) **Minimum Number of Control Bits**:

The minimum number of control bits for each field is the number of bits required to represent the number of control lines nin_i for each control field.

For each control field, the number of bits required is log⁡2ni\log_2 n_i. For all control fields:

- C0: 2 bits
- C1: 2 bits
- C2: 2 bits
- C3: 4 bits
- C4: 3 bits
- C5: 4 bits
- C6: 3 bits
- C7: 1 bit
- C8: 3 bits
- C9: 5 bits

Total: 2+2+2+4+3+4+3+1+3+5=33 bits2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 33 \, \text{bits}

#### (b) **Maximum Number of Control Bits (Horizontal Format)**:

In a horizontal format, each control field could have all its control lines active simultaneously, so each control field would need as many bits as there are control lines. Thus, for each control field, the number of bits is nin_i.

The total number of bits for a purely horizontal format:

4+4+3+11+9+16+7+1+8+22=85 bits4 + 4 + 3 + 11 + 9 + 16 + 7 + 1 + 8 + 22 = 85 \, \text{bits}

---

### **8. Differences Between Microinstruction Types**

#### (a) **Vertical vs Horizontal Microinstructions**:

- **Vertical**: Each microinstruction is shorter but involves more steps to execute because fewer control lines are specified per instruction.
- **Horizontal**: Each microinstruction is longer but can specify many control lines to activate simultaneously, allowing faster execution with fewer steps.

#### (b) **Microprogramming vs Hardwired Control**:

- **Microprogramming**: Uses a memory-based approach to define control sequences; flexible but slower due to memory access.
- **Hardwired Control**: Uses fixed logic circuits to generate control signals; faster but less flexible.

### **9. Conditional Branch Instruction (Single-Bus Architecture)** (continued)

To generate the necessary control signals for a conditional branch instruction, the steps would include checking the condition (e.g., if zero flag is set, then jump) and then either continuing with the next instruction or branching.

The micro-operations for a conditional branch instruction would be as follows:

1. **Fetch the instruction**:
    - Activate the control signals to load the Program Counter (PC) into the Instruction Register (IR).
    - Signal for reading memory.
    - Control line for incrementing PC.
2. **Check the condition** (i.e., zero flag, or carry flag):
    - The condition is checked (e.g., Z flag for zero condition).
    - The condition check could be performed using a logic unit.
3. **If the condition is met, jump to the target address**:
    - If the condition is satisfied, the next control signal would set the Program Counter (PC) to the target address, which could be specified in the instruction.
    - Otherwise, continue with the next instruction in sequence.

For example:

- **Step 1**: Fetch the instruction from memory.
- **Step 2**: Check the condition flag (e.g., if Z flag is set, meaning zero condition).
- **Step 3**: If the condition is met, load the target address into the Program Counter (PC).
- **Step 4**: If the condition is not met, continue to the next instruction.

Control signals could include:

- **Memory Read**: To fetch the instruction.
- **Condition Check**: For evaluating flags (e.g., Z flag).
- **PC Update**: If the jump is taken.

---

### **10. Microprogram for the Fetch Instruction**

Here is an outline of how you would write a microprogram for the **fetch instruction** in both one-bus and two-bus datapaths:

#### (a) **One-Bus Datapath**:

1. **Fetch the instruction**:
    
    - The PC's value is sent to memory to read the instruction.
    - The instruction is loaded into the IR.
    - The control signal activates the memory read operation, and the data from memory is transferred to the Instruction Register (IR).
    
    **Control Signals**:
    - **PC → MAR**: Transfer the PC to the Memory Address Register (MAR).
    - **Memory Read**: Activate the memory read signal to fetch data from memory.
    - **IR ← MDR**: Transfer the memory data (MDR) into the Instruction Register (IR).
    - **PC ← PC + 1**: Increment the Program Counter to point to the next instruction.

#### (b) **Two-Bus Datapath**:

1. **Fetch the instruction**:
    
    - The first bus (Bus 1) transfers the PC address to the MAR.
    - The second bus (Bus 2) handles the transfer of data from memory to the MDR and then into the IR.
    
    **Control Signals**:
    - **PC → MAR**: The Program Counter's value is placed on the MAR bus (Bus 1).
    - **Memory Read**: Signal memory to read the instruction.
    - **MDR → IR**: The data from the Memory Data Register (MDR) is transferred to the Instruction Register (IR).
    - **PC ← PC + 1**: Update the PC to point to the next instruction.

In both cases, the microprogram consists of two main steps: reading the instruction from memory and placing it into the Instruction Register (IR), followed by incrementing the Program Counter (PC) to fetch the next instruction.

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Instruction Bit Requirements**:
    
    - For two operand registers and one result register in a machine with 64 general-purpose registers, 18 bits are required.
    - For three memory addresses in a machine with 64KB of memory, 48 bits are needed.
2. **Micro-operations** for load, store, and jump instructions vary based on the datapath architecture (one-bus, two-bus, three-bus systems).
    
3. **Control Signal Generation**:

    - Microprogramming uses a table-based or memory-based system to generate control signals, with horizontal and vertical formats for efficiency.
4. **Data Movement Systems**:
    
    - Dedicated connections are fast but inflexible.
    - One-bus systems are simple but can be slower due to bus contention.
    - Two-bus and three-bus systems allow greater parallelism and faster data movement but are more complex.
5. **Microprogramming vs Hardwired**:
    
    - Vertical microinstructions use shorter steps, while horizontal ones specify many control signals per step.
    - Microprogramming is flexible but slower, whereas hardwired control is faster but less flexible.
6. **Control Field Encoding**: The number of bits required for control signals depends on the number of distinct lines for each control field. A minimum of 33 bits and a maximum of 85 bits are required.
    
7. **Fetch Instruction in One-Bus and Two-Bus Systems**: Microprograms for instruction fetch differ in the number of buses and the sequence of control signals, with two-bus systems offering more parallelism.
