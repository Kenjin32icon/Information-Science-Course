    # **Exercises**:
### Exercise 1: Reverse the bits stored in a 16-bit register R0

To reverse the bits in R0, we can iterate through each bit of the register and shift them into their correct reversed position.

```assembly
; Reverse the bits in 16-bit register R0
reverse_bits:
    MOV R1, #0      ; R1 will hold the reversed bits
    MOV R2, #16     ; R2 will count down from 16 (number of bits)
reverse_loop:
    ROL R0, R0, #1  ; Rotate left R0 by 1 bit (bit shifting)
    ROR R1, R1, #1  ; Rotate right R1 by 1 bit (bit shifting reversed bits)
    SUB R2, R2, #1  ; Decrement bit counter
    CMP R2, #0      ; Check if we have processed all 16 bits
    BNE reverse_loop ; If not, continue
    ; R0 now holds the reversed bits
```

### Exercise 2: Effective Address and Registers

For each instruction, we'll evaluate the effective address and register contents:

1. **(a) ADD (R0)+, R2**
    
    `R0 = 1500, R2 = 1000`
    
    - Effective address: The value in R0 (1500) is used, and then R0 is incremented.
    - After execution:
        - R2 = R2 + [1500] (content of memory at address 1500)
        - R0 = 1501 (R0 is incremented)
2. **(b) SUBTRACT 2(R1), R2**
    
    `R1 = 4500, R2 = 1000`
    
    - Effective address: 4500 + 2 = 4502.
    - After execution:
        - R2 = R2 - [4502] (content of memory at address 4502)
3. **(c) MOVE 500(R0), R2**
    
    `R0 = 1500, R2 = 1000`
    
    - Effective address: 1500 + 500 = 2000.
    - After execution:
        - R2 = [2000] (content of memory at address 2000)
4. **(d) LOAD #5000, R2**
    
    `R2 = 1000`
    
    - Effective address: Immediate value 5000 is loaded into R2.
    - After execution:
        - R2 = 5000
5. **(e) STORE R0, 100(R2)**
    
    `R0 = 1500, R2 = 1000`
    
    - Effective address: 1000 + 100 = 1100.
    - After execution:
        - Content of memory at address 1100 = R0 (1500)

### Exercise 3: Stack Operations

Assume SP points to the top of the stack.

#### (a) Pop the top three elements, add them, and push the result back

```assembly
    ; Pop the first element
    POP R0
    ; Pop the second element
    POP R1
    ; Pop the third element
    POP R2
    ; Add the three values
    ADD R0, R1, R0
    ADD R0, R2, R0
    ; Push the result back onto the stack
    PUSH R0
```

#### (b) Pop the top two elements, subtract them, and push the result back

```assembly
    ; Pop the first element
    POP R0
    ; Pop the second element
    POP R1
    ; Subtract the two values
    SUB R0, R1, R0
    ; Push the result back onto the stack
    PUSH R0
```

#### (c) Push five elements (one at a time) onto the stack

```assembly
    MOV R0, #val1
    PUSH R0
    MOV R0, #val2
    PUSH R0
    MOV R0, #val3
    PUSH R0
    MOV R0, #val4
    PUSH R0
    MOV R0, #val5
    PUSH R0
```

#### (d) Remove the top five elements from the stack

```assembly
    POP R0
    POP R1
    POP R2
    POP R3
    POP R4
```

#### (e) Copy the third element from the stack into R0

```assembly
    POP R0        ; Pop the first element
    POP R1        ; Pop the second element
    POP R2        ; Copy the third element into R0
```

### Exercise 4: Add Arrays

Assume `A`, `B`, and `C` are arrays stored in memory. The result should be stored at memory location starting at 3000.

#### (a) One-Address Machine

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Load address of A
    MOV R1, #2000  ; Load address of B
    MOV R2, #3000  ; Load address of C
    MOV R3, #100   ; Set loop count
loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load A[i] into accumulator
    ADD (R1)       ; Add B[i] to accumulator
    STA (R2)       ; Store the result in C[i]
    INC R0         ; Increment A pointer
    INC R1         ; Increment B pointer
    INC R2         ; Increment C pointer
    DEC R3         ; Decrement loop count
    JNZ loop       ; Repeat until all elements are processed
```

#### (b) One-and-Half Address Machine

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Load address of A
    MOV R1, #2000  ; Load address of B
    MOV R2, #3000  ; Load address of C
    MOV R3, #100   ; Set loop count
loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load A[i]
    ADD (R1)       ; Add B[i]
    STA (R2)       ; Store result
    ADD R0, #1     ; Increment pointers
    ADD R1, #1
    ADD R2, #1
    DEC R3         ; Decrement loop counter
    JNZ loop
```

#### (c) Two-Address Machine

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Load address of A
    MOV R1, #2000  ; Load address of B
    MOV R2, #3000  ; Load address of C
    MOV R3, #100   ; Set loop counter
loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load A[i]
    ADD (R1)       ; Add B[i]
    STA (R2)       ; Store in C[i]
    INC R0         ; Increment addresses
    INC R1
    INC R2
    DEC R3         ; Decrement counter
    JNZ loop
```

#### (d) Three-Address Machine

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Load address of A
    MOV R1, #2000  ; Load address of B
    MOV R2, #3000  ; Load address of C
    MOV R3, #100   ; Set loop count
loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load A[i]
    ADD (R1)       ; Add B[i]
    STA (R2)       ; Store in C[i]
    INC R0         ; Increment addresses
    INC R1
    INC R2
    DEC R3         ; Decrement counter
    JNZ loop
```

#### (e) Zero-Address Machine

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Load address of A
    MOV R1, #2000  ; Load address of B
    MOV R2, #3000  ; Load address of C
    MOV R3, #100   ; Set loop count
loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load A[i]
    ADD (R1)       ; Add B[i]
    STA (R2)       ; Store result in C[i]
    INC R0
    INC R1
    INC R2
    DEC R3
    JNZ loop
```

### Exercise 5: `C = C + A * B` for Different Instruction Classes

The program for this will follow the same basic structure but will differ based on how many operands are handled by the machine at once.

- **One-Address Machine:** Similar to Exercise 4, but involves one operand at a time.
- **One-and-Half Address Machine:** Similar to Exercise 4 but the machine can handle one and a half operands (e.g., one in the accumulator and another in memory).
- **Two-Address Machine:** Handles two operands at once.
- **Three-Address Machine:** Can directly handle three operands in a single instruction.
- **Zero-Address Machine:** Assumes implicit operands, so the instruction uses the stack or accumulator directly.



### Exercise 6: Calculate the Average Score for Each Student

In this exercise, you have scores for 50 students, each having five scores stored sequentially across five memory locations (starting at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000). You need to calculate the average score of each student and store it at memory location 6000.

Assume:

- Student scores for tests 1-5 are stored in memory at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 for each student.
- The average score for each student will be stored starting at memory location 6000.

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000  ; Start of the scores for the first student
    MOV R1, #6000  ; Start of memory for storing averages
    MOV R2, #50    ; Number of students
    MOV R3, #5     ; Number of tests
    MOV R4, #0     ; Clear sum register

average_loop:
    MOV R5, #0     ; Clear sum register for the current student
    MOV R6, #5     ; Loop through the 5 tests
test_loop:
    LDA (R0)       ; Load score from the current test (R0 points to the first student's scores)
    ADD R5, R5     ; Add to sum
    INC R0         ; Increment to the next test score
    DEC R6         ; Decrease the loop counter
    JNZ test_loop  ; Repeat for all 5 tests
    
    DIV R5, #5     ; Divide sum by 5 to get average
    STA (R1)       ; Store the average in memory at 6000, 6001, etc.
    INC R1         ; Increment the pointer for storing averages
    DEC R2         ; Decrease the student counter
    JNZ average_loop ; Repeat for all 50 students
```

### Exercise 7: Repeat Exercise 6 with Byte Addressable Memory and 32-Bit Scores

In this case, each score occupies 32 bits, and memory is byte addressable. We need to account for the fact that each score will take 4 bytes. Here's the updated program:

```assembly
    MOV R0, #1000      ; Start of the scores for the first student
    MOV R1, #6000      ; Start of memory for storing averages
    MOV R2, #50        ; Number of students
    MOV R3, #5         ; Number of tests
    MOV R4, #0         ; Clear sum register

average_loop:
    MOV R5, #0         ; Clear sum register for the current student
    MOV R6, #5         ; Loop through the 5 tests
test_loop:
    LDA (R0)           ; Load the first 32-bit score (assumed address points to byte)
    ADD R5, R5         ; Add score to sum
    INC R0, #4         ; Move to the next 32-bit score (4 bytes per score)
    DEC R6             ; Decrement the test counter
    JNZ test_loop      ; Repeat for all 5 tests
    
    DIV R5, #5         ; Divide sum by 5 for the average
    STA (R1)           ; Store the average in memory (32 bits)
    INC R1, #4         ; Increment memory address by 4 for next average (32 bits per average)
    DEC R2             ; Decrease student counter
    JNZ average_loop   ; Repeat for all 50 students
```

### Exercise 8: Students' IDs Are Not Sequential

Here, we assume the student IDs are not sequential. Each student's ID will be used as a pointer to their test scores. We need to use indirect addressing or a pointer-based approach to access each student's scores.

```assembly
    MOV R1, #1000    ; Address of first student's ID
    MOV R2, #6000    ; Address for storing averages
    MOV R3, #50      ; Number of students
    MOV R4, #5       ; Number of tests

average_loop:
    LDA (R1)         ; Load current student's ID (used as a pointer to the scores)
    MOV R0, R2       ; Initialize R0 with the student's score base address
    MOV R5, #0       ; Clear sum register

test_loop:
    LDA (R0)         ; Load score from memory
    ADD R5, R5       ; Add score to sum
    INC R0           ; Move to next score
    DEC R4           ; Decrement test counter
    JNZ test_loop    ; Repeat for all 5 tests

    DIV R5, #5       ; Divide sum by 5 for the average
    STA (R2)         ; Store average
    INC R2           ; Increment memory location for the next student
    INC R1           ; Move to next student ID
    DEC R3           ; Decrease the student counter
    JNZ average_loop ; Repeat for all 50 students
```

### Exercise 9: Use an Array S(50, 5) to Store Scores

Here, you are working with a two-dimensional array where each student has five test scores. The data for 50 students and 5 tests is stored in memory, starting from memory location 4000.

The average scores will be stored in memory location based on the student’s ID.

```assembly
    MOV R1, #4000      ; Address of first element in the array S
    MOV R2, #6000      ; Start of memory for storing averages
    MOV R3, #50        ; Number of students
    MOV R4, #5         ; Number of tests

average_loop:
    MOV R5, #0         ; Clear sum register
    MOV R6, #5         ; Loop through the 5 tests

test_loop:
    LDA (R1)           ; Load the score of the current test (S[i, j])
    ADD R5, R5         ; Add to sum
    INC R1             ; Move to the next test score for the current student
    DEC R6             ; Decrement the test counter
    JNZ test_loop      ; Repeat for all 5 tests
    
    DIV R5, #5         ; Divide sum by 5 for the average
    STA (R2)           ; Store the average at memory location 6000
    INC R2             ; Increment memory pointer for the next student’s average
    DEC R3             ; Decrease student counter
    JNZ average_loop   ; Repeat for all 50 students
```

### Exercise 10: Subroutine for Averaging with Parameters

In this exercise, you are required to write a subroutine to calculate averages, and the number of students, the number of tests, and the start of the scores array are passed in registers.

```assembly
    ; Main program calling the subroutine
    MOV R1, #50        ; Number of students
    MOV R2, #5         ; Number of tests
    MOV R3, #4000      ; Start of the array S
    CALL average_scores

average_scores:
    ; Arguments are passed in registers: R1 = number of students, R2 = number of tests, R3 = start of scores
    MOV R4, #0         ; Clear sum register
    MOV R5, #5         ; Number of tests
    
average_loop:
    MOV R6, #0         ; Clear sum for current student
    MOV R7, R2         ; Number of tests

test_loop:
    LDA (R3)           ; Load the test score from the array
    ADD R6, R6         ; Add to sum
    INC R3             ; Move to next test score for the student
    DEC R7             ; Decrement tests counter
    JNZ test_loop      ; Repeat for all 5 tests

    DIV R6, #5         ; Calculate average
    STA (R3)           ; Store average
    DEC R1             ; Decrease student counter
    JNZ average_loop   ; Repeat for all students
    RET                ; Return from subroutine
```

These solutions provide a basic framework for working with arrays and performing memory operations in assembly language for various scenarios. Adjustments may be needed based on specific hardware or architecture requirements. Let me know if you need further clarification!
