# Definitions
**[[Citation Analysis]]** is a quantitative method used to assess the relative importance or impact of an author, article, or publication by counting the number of times that work has been cited by other scholarly works. This analysis provides insights into how frequently a piece of research is referenced, which can serve as an indicator of its influence within a particular field or discipline.

# Purposes of Citation Analysis

1. **Establishing Impact**: Citation analysis can be used to determine the impact that a specific work has had on subsequent research. By examining citation counts, researchers can gauge how influential a particular article or publication has been in shaping further studies or discussions.
    
2. **Understanding a Field or Topic**: Researchers may conduct citation analysis to gain a deeper understanding of a specific field or topic. By analyzing citation patterns, they can identify key works, influential authors, and emerging trends within the literature.
    
3. **Assessing Author Impact**: Citation analysis can also be employed to evaluate the impact of a particular author. By counting the citations of an author's works, one can assess their contribution to their field and compare it to that of other researchers.

# Citation Metrics
[[Citation metrics ]]are quantitative measures used to evaluate the impact and influence of scholarly works, authors, and publications. Here are some common citation metrics:

1. **Total Number of Citations**: This metric counts the total number of times a particular work (article, book, etc.) has been cited by other publications. It provides a straightforward measure of the work's overall impact within the academic community.
    
2. **Average Number of Citations per Paper**: This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of citations by the total number of papers published by an author or within a specific publication. It helps to assess the average impact of each individual work.
    
3. **Number of Citations per Author (Co-authored)**: This metric counts the total citations received by an author, taking into account all co-authored works. It provides insight into the author's overall contribution to the field, regardless of collaboration.
    
4. **Number of Citations per Author per Year**: This metric calculates the average number of citations received by an author per year. It can help track an author's impact over time and assess trends in their research influence.
    
5. **Number of Authors per Paper**: This metric counts the total number of authors associated with a particular paper. It provides insight into collaboration patterns within a specific field or publication.
    
6. **Average Number of Authors per Paper**: This metric is calculated by summing the author counts across all papers and dividing by the total number of papers. It helps to understand the typical level of collaboration in a given area of research.

# H-Index

The **H-Index** is an author-level metric that quantifies both the productivity and citation impact of a scholar's scientific publications. It provides a balanced measure of an author's output and the influence of their work within the academic community.

### Key Features of the H-Index

- **Basis of Calculation**: The H-Index is determined by examining the set of a scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations those papers have received. Specifically, it identifies the maximum value of ( h ) such that the author has published ( h ) papers that have each been cited at least ( h ) times.
    
- **Interpretation**: For example, an H-Index of 10 means that the author has at least 10 papers that have each been cited at least 10 times. This metric effectively highlights both the quantity of research output and its impact.
    

## Individual H-Index

The **Individual H-Index** is a variation of the standard H-Index that accounts for the effects of co-authorship, providing a more nuanced view of an author's contributions.

### Key Features of the Individual H-Index

- **Adjustment for Co-Authorship**: The Individual H-Index is calculated by dividing the standard H-Index by the average number of authors in the articles that contribute to the H-Index. This adjustment helps to mitigate the influence of multiple authors on citation counts.
    
- **Framework for Apportioning Popularity**: By normalizing the H-Index in this way, the Individual H-Index offers a framework for attributing the popularity and impact of co-authored works to individual contributing authors. This is particularly useful in fields where collaboration is common.
    
- **Normalization of Influence**: The Individual H-Index provides a more accurate representation of an author's influence by accounting for the collaborative nature of research, allowing for a fairer comparison among authors with varying levels of co-authorship.

# i10-Index

The **i[[10-Index]]** is a citation metric developed by Google Scholar to evaluate the impact of a scholar's work. It provides a straightforward measure of the number of publications that have received a minimum number of citations.

- **Definition**: The i10-Index is defined as the number of publications authored by a scholar that have received at least 10 citations each. This metric focuses on the most cited works of an author, highlighting their contributions that have garnered significant attention within the academic community.
    
- **Purpose**: The i10-Index serves as a way to assess the impact of a scholar's work based on the citation counts of their most popular publications. It provides a clear indication of the number of influential works an author has produced.
    
- **Exclusivity**: The i10-Index is unique to Google Scholar and is not widely used in other citation databases or platforms. This exclusivity means that it may not be as recognized or utilized as other metrics like the H-Index or total citation counts.

# Journal Impact Factor (JIF)
The **Journal Impact Factor (JIF)** is a widely used metric that quantifies the average number of citations received by articles published in a specific academic journal over a defined period. It serves as an indicator of the journal's influence and prestige within the scholarly community.

### Key Features of the Journal Impact Factor

- **Definition**: The Journal Impact Factor is calculated by dividing the total number of citations received by all articles published in a journal during a specific year (or over a two-year period) by the total number of articles published in that journal during the same time frame.
    
    [ \text{Impact Factor} = \frac{\text{Citations in Year X to Articles Published in Years X-1 and X-2}}{\text{Total Articles Published in Years X-1 and X-2}} ]
    
- **Purpose**: The JIF is used to assess the importance or rank of a journal within its field. Journals with higher impact factors are often perceived as more prestigious and influential, which can affect authors' decisions on where to submit their work.
    
- **Citation Window**: The impact factor typically focuses on citations received in the first two years after publication. This time frame is chosen because it reflects the immediate impact of research articles, although some fields may have longer citation life cycles.

# Journal h5-Median

The **[[h5-Median]]** is another metric that complements the h5-Index by providing additional insights into the citation distribution of a journal's articles.

### Key Features of the h5-Median

- **Definition**: The h5-Median is the median number of citations received by the articles that contribute to the h5-Index. It represents the middle point in the distribution of citations for the articles considered in the h5-Index.
    
- **Focus on Consistency**: While the h5-Index emphasizes the most highly cited articles, the h5-Median provides a measure of the typical impact of articles in the journal. A high h5-Median indicates that many articles in the journal are consistently cited, rather than relying on a few highly cited outliers.
    

# Age-Weighted Citation Rate (AWCR)

The **[[Age-Weighted Citation Rate (AWCR)]]** is a metric that adjusts citation counts based on the age of the papers, providing a normalized view of their impact.

### Key Features of AWCR

- **Definition**: The AWCR measures the number of citations to an entire body of work, adjusted for the age of each individual paper. It accounts for the fact that older papers generally have more citations simply due to being available for a longer time.
    
- **Calculation**: AWCR is calculated by dividing the number of citations to a given paper by the age of that paper (in years). This normalization helps to provide a fair comparison of citation impact across papers of different ages.
    

# Immediacy Index

The **[[Immediacy Index]]** is a metric that assesses how quickly new research is being cited after publication.

### Key Features of the Immediacy Index

- **Definition**: The Immediacy Index is the average number of times an article is cited in the year of its publication. It reflects the immediate impact of newly published research.
    
- **Calculation**: The Immediacy Index is calculated by dividing the number of citations to articles published in a given year by the total number of articles published in that year.
    
- **Indication of Uptake**: A higher Immediacy Index suggests that the latest research is being rapidly adopted and cited by the academic community, indicating a strong interest in recent findings.
