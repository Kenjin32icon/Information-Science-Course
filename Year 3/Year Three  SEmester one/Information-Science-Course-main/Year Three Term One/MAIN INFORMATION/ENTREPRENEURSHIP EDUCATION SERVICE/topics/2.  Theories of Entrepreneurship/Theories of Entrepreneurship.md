**Sociological Theory**

    - **Social Influence:** Customs, taboos, rewards, restraints, nationalistic attitudes, and patriotism shape entrepreneurial behavior.
- **Social Structures:** The social structure and its economic and social incentives greatly affect entrepreneurial behavior.
- **Social Class:** Entrepreneurs often emerge from specific socioeconomic classes, and historical events can trigger entrepreneurial activities within a particular social group. For instance, the construction of the railway line in Kenya led to entrepreneurial activities among Indian migrants.
