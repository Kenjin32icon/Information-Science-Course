[[Theories of Entrepreneurship]]
Okay, here's a breakdown of the resources provided that can be used to discuss **Week 2: Theories of Entrepreneurship**, including the Sociology, Economic, Psychological, Causation, Entrepreneurial Bricolage, and Effectuation theories, based on the sources you've provided:

**I. Core Theories of Entrepreneurship (Sociology, Economic, Psychological)**

- **"ENT NOTES -Dec 2024 THEORIES OF ENTREPRENUERSHIP Revamped .pdf"**: This document is the most directly relevant resource for understanding the core theories.
    - **Economic Theory**:
        - **Entrepreneur's Function:** The economic theory views the entrepreneur as someone who **combines resources** to create new production organizations. They are responsible for **superintendence, control, and direction** within the business, aiming to maximize output at minimum cost.
        - **Market Dynamics**: Entrepreneurs are seen as forces that **disrupt equilibrium** in markets, connecting different markets, filling gaps, and introducing transformative inputs.
        - **Economic Incentives:** Economic gains and incentives like **taxation policy, industrial policy, infrastructure, and raw materials** are considered the main drivers for entrepreneurial activities.
        - **Economic Policy**: The economic policies and environment of a country heavily influence entrepreneurship development.
    - **Sociological Theory**:
        - **Social Culture**: This theory emphasizes that entrepreneurship emerges from **social and cultural values**, sanctions, and role expectations.
        - **Role Performance**: Sociologists see the entrepreneur as a **role performer** who fulfills societal expectations.
        - **Social Influence**: Customs, taboos, rewards, restraints, nationalism, and patriotism influence entrepreneurial behavior.
        - **Social Structures:** A scholar, J. Kunkeil, suggests that entrepreneurial behavior is a function of **past and present social structures**.
        - **Social Class**: Entrepreneurs often emerge from specific **socio-economic classes**. The example of Indian migrants building railways in Kenya highlights the role of social class in driving entrepreneurship.
    - **Psychological Theory**:
        - **Innovation and Creativity:** This perspective, as articulated by Joseph Schumpeter, characterizes entrepreneurs as **innovators** with unique views of resources. They are **problem solvers** who introduce new products, methods of production, and sources of supply.
        - **Achievement Motivation:** Individuals with a **high need for achievement**, a desire for responsibility, and a measure of task performance are often drawn to entrepreneurship.
        - **Status Withdrawal**: Hagen's theory suggests that the **withdrawal of status** can trigger a change in personality formation, leading to entrepreneurial activities. This could arise from displacement, inconsistency in status, non-acceptance of expected status, or migration.

**II. Additional Theories Mentioned in Course Outline**
