## Detailed Timeline of Main Events

This timeline synthesizes information from various sources related to systems analysis and design methodologies and concepts. It's structured around the general lifecycle of system development and the introduction of specific methodologies like SDLC and RUP.

**Early Concepts & Foundations:**

- **Ongoing:** Development of the fundamental concept of a "system" as an orderly grouping of interdependent components with a specific objective.
- **Ongoing:** Recognition of the two major components of systems development: Systems Analysis (understanding the problem) and Systems Design (planning the solution).
- **Ongoing:** Development of different types of information systems to support business needs, including Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Management Information Systems (MIS), and Decision Support Systems (DSS).
- **Pre-1970s (Implied):** Emergence of structured approaches to software development, leading to the formalization of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

**The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**

- **Early Era (Implied):** Establishment of the SDLC as a traditional, phased methodology for developing, maintaining, and replacing information systems.
- **Ongoing:** SDLC is characterized by distinct phases:
- **Planning:** Identifying, analyzing, prioritizing, and arranging an organization's information system needs.
- **Analysis:** Studying and structuring system requirements. Techniques include interviews, JAD, questionnaires, document analysis, observation, and RAD. Modeling begins (functional, structural, behavioral).
- **Design:** Converting the recommended solution into logical (functional features independent of platform) and then physical (technology-specific details) system specifications. Includes Object-Oriented Design and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) considerations.
- **Implementation:** Coding, testing, installing, and supporting the information system within the organization. Conversion strategies include direct, parallel, pilot, and phased approaches.
- **Maintenance:** Systematically repairing and improving the information system (corrective, adaptive, perfective). Includes periodic evaluation and updating.
- **Ongoing:** Recognition of the "Waterfall approach" as a linear and sequential model within SDLC, where phases are completed in order with limited backtracking. Its key limitation is its lack of flexibility.
- **Ongoing:** Development of various modeling techniques within SDLC, including Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) with context diagrams and leveled diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, and State Chart Diagrams.
- **Ongoing:** Emphasis on documentation throughout the SDLC, stored in a central "repository."
- **Ongoing:** Integration of testing activities within the SDLC, evolving through unit testing, integration testing (bottom-up, top-down, sandwich, modified sandwich, big-bang), system testing (functional, performance, acceptance, deployment), and regression testing.

**Emergence of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD):**

- **Mid-late 20th Century:** Development of Object-Oriented (OO) concepts, focusing on objects, classes, and their relationships.
- **Late 20th Century:** Formalization of Object Modeling Technique (OMT) as a specific approach to OOAD, involving object, dynamic, and functional models across analysis and design phases. Key concepts include classes, associations, aggregation, states, events, and data flow.

**The Unified Modeling Language (UML):**

- **Mid-1990s:** Development and initial standardization of UML as an industry-standard graphical language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting software system artifacts.
- **1995:** Introduction of Unified Method 0.8, a precursor to UML.
- **1996-2003:** Evolution of UML through various versions (0.9, 0.91, 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.0), unifying different OO modeling approaches.
- **Ongoing:** UML provides standardized diagrams (use-case, class, sequence, state, component, deployment, etc.) to represent different views of a system for various stakeholders.

**The Rational Unified Process (RUP):**

- **Late 1990s (Implied):** Development of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) by Rational Software Corporation.
- **Ongoing:** RUP is introduced as an iterative software development methodology providing a structured approach to systems analysis and design.
- **Ongoing:** RUP structures the software lifecycle into four consecutive phases:
- **Inception:** Establishing the business case and project scope.
- **Elaboration:** Analyzing the problem domain, establishing the architectural foundation, developing the project plan, and mitigating high risks.
- **Construction:** Incrementally building the product components based on the established architecture.
- **Transition:** Deploying the software to end-users, including testing, training, and feedback.
- **Ongoing:** RUP emphasizes iterative development within each phase, with each iteration resulting in a release (internal or external) of an executable system.
- **Ongoing:** RUP uses UML as its modeling language.
- **Ongoing:** Each phase in RUP is concluded with a major milestone: Lifecycle Objective (end of Inception), Lifecycle Architecture (end of Elaboration), Initial Operational Capability (end of Construction), and Product Release (end of Transition).

**Modern Trends (Implied):**

- **Ongoing:** Emergence of accelerated analysis methods, such as prototyping and Rapid Application Development (RAD), to quickly identify requirements.
- **Ongoing:** Development of agile methodologies as alternative, iterative approaches to software development.
- **Ongoing:** Emphasis on continuous testing and integration throughout the development lifecycle.

## Cast of Characters

Here are the principle people and roles mentioned in the sources, with brief bios:

- **Jackson Alunga:** An instructor or lecturer in Information Systems Analysis and Design, likely at TUKenya (based on the email address domain). He is the author of several of the lecture materials provided ("LECTURE 1.pdf", "Lecture 2.pdf", "Lecture 3.pdf", "Lecture 5 - UML.pdf", "Lecture 5 OOAD.pdf", "Lecture Rational Unified Process.pdf", "Lecture 6.pdf"). His lectures cover a range of topics from SDLC and OOAD to UML and testing.
- **Systems Analyst:** A professional whose job involves systems analysis. This includes gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems within a system, and using this information to recommend improvements or new systems. They interact with users, managers, and other IT staff.
- **Systems Designer:** A professional responsible for the process of planning a new business system or one to replace or complement an existing one. They take the requirements identified by the systems analyst and create the blueprint for the solution.
- **Software Developer/Programmer:** Individuals who write the code for the information system based on the design specifications created during the systems design phase.
- **Tester:** Individuals responsible for verifying that the developed system meets the specified requirements and works correctly. They design and execute test cases across various levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance, deployment).
- **User (End-User):** The individuals who will ultimately use the information system. Their needs and expectations are critical in the systems analysis and design process, and they are involved in requirements gathering and acceptance testing.
- **Manager:** Individuals within the organization who oversee business operations and decision-making. They rely on information systems like MIS and DSS to support their planning, control, and strategic activities.
- **Client/Customer:** The individual or organization who commissions the development of the information system. They define the requirements and are involved in acceptance testing to ensure the system meets their needs.
- **Object Management Group (OMG):** A standards organization mentioned as being responsible for the standardization of UML.
- **Gorry and Morton:** Individuals credited with coining the term "Decision Support System (DSS)."
- **Rational Software Corporation (now part of IBM):** The company that developed the Rational Unified Process (RUP), an iterative software development methodology.
