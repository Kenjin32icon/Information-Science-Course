1. from the Course syllabus and plan in the ALLQ 3211 INFORMATION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN extract a .md Course syllabus table
2. Focusing on the Course syllabus table i will prompt you design detailed notes that are structured in an easy readable and understandable format for The topics that I will provide you from now on.
