## Quiz Answer Key

1. The two major components are **systems analysis** and **systems design**. Systems analysis focuses on gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending improvements. Systems design is the process of planning a new business system or one to replace or complement an existing one.
2. A system is an orderly grouping of interdependent components linked together according to a plan to achieve a specific objective. The three basic implications are that a system must be designed to achieve a predetermined objective, that components are interdependent and must do their share of work, and that an orderly grouping of components is required for a successful system.
3. The Waterfall approach is a linear sequence of stages (planning, analysis, design, implementation) to develop a system, followed from beginning to end without revisiting prior stages. A key limitation is the lack of flexibility to go back and make changes once a phase is completed.
4. A repository is a location (or set of locations) where systems analysts, designers, and builders keep all documentation associated with one or more systems or projects. An example is a network directory of computer-generated files containing project correspondence, reports, and data models.
5. A **functional requirement** describes the activities and services a system must provide (e.g., "The system must allow users to create new customer accounts"). A **nonfunctional requirement** describes other features, characteristics, and constraints of a satisfactory system (e.g., "The system must have a response time of under 3 seconds for all transactions").
6. A context diagram is a high-level, overall picture of an application or system, showing its boundaries and the external entities that interact with it. It is then decomposed, or exploded, into successively lower levels of detail in subsequent DFDs to provide more specific views of the system's processes and data flows.
7. UML (Unified Modeling Language) is an industry-standard graphical language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. It is used because graphical notation can express ideas more clearly than natural language or detailed code, helps acquire an overall view of a system, and provides a standardized way to model software.
8. The main goal of system testing is to validate that the complete and integrated system meets specified requirements. Three types of system testing are **functional testing** (validates functional requirements), **performance testing** (validates non-functional requirements like speed and security), and **acceptance testing** (validates the client's expectations and ensures the system meets their needs).
9. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an iterative software development methodology that provides a structured approach to systems analysis and design. It structures the lifecycle into four consecutive phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition, with work occurring in iterations across these phases.
10. Stubs are partial implementations of components that a tested unit depends on. They return fake values to allow testing of a specific component without needing its dependent components to be fully developed.

## Essay Format Questions

1. Discuss the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as a traditional methodology for developing information systems. Describe its main phases and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this approach in modern software development.
2. Compare and contrast process-oriented and object-oriented approaches to systems analysis and design, drawing upon the concepts and techniques presented in the provided materials.
3. Explain the role and importance of modeling in the systems analysis and design process. Discuss different types of models, such as data flow diagrams and UML diagrams, and how they contribute to understanding and designing information systems.
4. Describe the different strategies for software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Analyze the benefits and challenges associated with top-down, bottom-up, and sandwich testing strategies.
5. Discuss the Rational Unified Process (RUP) as an iterative development methodology. Explain its key phases, disciplines, and how its iterative nature differs from traditional linear approaches like the Waterfall model, considering the potential advantages and disadvantages.
