### 1. Overview of Business Information Systems Development

- **The aim of this course is to introduce students to the analysis, design, and implementation of computer-based information systems (CBIS)**. This implies that business information systems development is a core focus, encompassing the entire lifecycle from understanding business needs to creating and deploying technology-based solutions.
- The course also intends **to provide the student with a background into how IT supports a business environment**. This highlights that business information systems development is not just about technology, but about aligning IT with business goals and operations.
- Business information systems development can generally be understood as having two major components: **Systems analysis and Systems design**. These two areas are interdependent and crucial for creating effective systems.
- Looking at a **Modern Approach to Systems Analysis and Design**, the focus has evolved over time:
    - **1950s:** The primary focus was on the **efficient automation of existing processes**.
    - **1960s:** The advent of 3rd Generation Languages (3GL) and more powerful computers allowed for more complex system development.
    - **1970s:** **System development began to be viewed and approached more like an engineering discipline**, emphasizing structured methodologies and planning.
    - **1980s:** Major breakthroughs occurred with 4th Generation Languages (4GL), Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools, and object-oriented methods, leading to increased productivity and new development paradigms.
    - **1990s:** The focus shifted towards **system integration**, connecting disparate systems, and utilizing client/server platforms and the Internet.
    - **The new century:** Current trends include **Web application development**, leveraging wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and building **component-based applications** that can be reused and integrated more easily.

### 2. Definition of Systems Analysis and Systems Design

To understand systems analysis and design in the context of business information systems development, it's essential to first define what a system is and then explore the specific roles of analysis and design.

#### 2.1. What is a System?

- A **system** is defined as **an orderly grouping of interdependent components linked together according to a plan to achieve a specific objective**.
- The study of systems concepts has three basic implications:
    1. **A system must be designed to achieve a predetermined objective.** The purpose of the system drives its design.
    2. **Interrelationships and interdependence must exist among the components.** The different parts of the system must work together and rely on each other for proper functioning. The output of one subsystem is often the required input for another.
    3. **The objectives of the organization as a whole have a higher priority than the objectives of its subsystems.** Individual parts of the system should contribute to the overall organizational goals.
- All systems share certain **characteristics**:
    - **Organization:** Implies structure and order, the arrangement of components that helps to achieve objectives. For example, a business's hierarchical structure.
    - **Interaction:** Refers to how each component functions with other components of the system.
    - **Interdependence:** Subsystems rely on the input of other subsystems for proper functioning.
    - **Integration:** Refers to the holism of systems, where parts work together within the system even though each part performs a unique function.
    - **Central Objective:** Every system must have a reason for its existence, although political and organizational considerations can sometimes obscure the real objective.
- Key **elements of a system** to consider when reconstructing or analyzing one:
    1. **Outputs and inputs:** What the system produces and what it takes in.
    2. **Processor(s):** The component(s) that transform inputs into outputs.
    3. **Control:** The elements that guide the operation of the system.
    4. **Feedback:** Information about the system's performance used for adjustments.
    5. **Environment:** The external context in which the system operates.
    6. **Boundaries and interface:** What separates the system from its environment and how they interact.
- Systems can be classified in different ways:
    - **Physical or abstract:** Physical systems are tangible, while abstract systems are conceptual (e.g., a model).
    - **Open or closed:** Open systems interact with their environment, while closed systems have limited or no interaction. Information systems are typically open systems. Open systems exhibit characteristics like input from outside, processing, output, operation in cycles through feedback, differentiation (specialization of functions), and equifinality (achieving goals through different paths).
    - **"Man-made" information systems:** Systems created by humans to serve specific purposes.

#### 2.2. Information Systems

- An **information system** can be defined as **a set of devices, procedures, and operating systems designed around user-based criteria to produce information and communicate it to the user for planning, control, and performance**.
- A business has several information systems, each designed for a specific purpose:
    - **Formal Information System:** Based on the organizational chart and concerned with authority, communication, and workflow.
    - **Informal Information System:** Employee-based, developed to meet personnel and vocational needs and solve work-related problems. Understanding this system is useful during analysis for gaining employee cooperation.
    - **Computer-Based Information Systems:** Rely on the computer for handling business applications. These include:
        - **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS):** Automate the handling of data about business activities (transactions) with a process orientation.
        - **Management Information Systems (MIS):** Convert raw data from TPS into a meaningful form, with a data orientation, to provide management with a comprehensive picture of specific operations. MIS supports middle and top management for forecasting, analysis, and reporting.
        - **Decision Support Systems (DSS):** Designed to help decision-makers by providing an interactive environment for decision making, often involving data warehouses. DSS assists management in making decisions and relies heavily on operations research.
- There are three categories of information related to managerial levels:
    - **Strategic Information:** For long-range planning policies, used by upper management (supported by DSS).
    - **Managerial Information:** For implementation and control, used by middle management (supported by MIS).
    - **Operational Information:** Short-term, daily information used to operate departments (supported by data processing systems).

#### 2.3. Systems Analysis

- **System analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and using the information to recommend improvements to the system**. This is the primary responsibility of the **systems analyst**.
- **Information systems analysis** specifically focuses on **the development phases in a project that primarily focus on the business problem, independent of any technology that can or will be used to implement a solution to that problem**.
- Systems analysis is a **problem-solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose**.
- The systems analyst needs a background in **systems theory and organizations** to effectively determine the type of information needed and the level at which it is required.

#### 2.4. Systems Design

- **System design is the process of planning a new business system or one to replace or complement an existing system**.
- It is also called **systems synthesis** and is a **complementary problem-solving technique to systems analysis**. It involves **reassembling a system’s component pieces back into a complete system—hopefully, an improved system**. This may involve adding, deleting, and changing pieces relative to the original system.
- During the design phase of the **Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, **a description of the recommended solution is converted into logical and then physical system specifications**.
    - **Logical design** describes all functional features of the system independently of any computer platform.
    - **Physical design** transforms the logical specifications into technology-specific details from which programming and system construction can be accomplished.

### 3. Importance of Systems Analysis and Design

- System Analysis and Design is crucial for **examining a business situation with the intent of improving it through better procedures and methods**.
- It **relates to shaping organizations, improving performance and achieving objectives for profitability and growth**. The emphasis is on systems in action and the relationships among subsystems to meet common goals.
- **System Development Methodology is a standard process followed in an organization to conduct all the steps necessary to analyze, design, implement, and maintain information systems**. Systems analysis and design are integral parts of this methodology.
- Understanding the old system through analysis is necessary **before planning a new or complementary system**. This understanding helps determine how computers can best be used to make operations more effective.
- The course itself emphasizes the **importance of systems analysis and design** in its introduction.
- **Documentation**, a key output of both analysis and design phases, is vital for various reasons:
    - **Depicting how the system works.**
    - **Training users.**
    - **Designing new systems.**
    - **Controlling system development and maintenance costs.**
    - **Standardizing communications with others.**
    - **Auditing ISs.**
    - **Documenting business processes.**
    - **Complying with regulations (e.g., Sarbanes Oxley Act).**
    - **Establishing accountability.**

In summary, Week 1 of this course lays the foundation by defining key concepts related to systems, information systems, and the fundamental processes of systems analysis and systems design. It also underscores the importance of these disciplines in the context of business operations and information technology development.
