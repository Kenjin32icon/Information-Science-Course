## Detailed Notes for Week 5, Systems Analysis: Requirements Determination/ Information Gathering Techniques

Based on the sources, the process of **systems analysis** focuses on understanding the business problem and defining what a new system should do. A crucial part of this phase is **requirements determination** or **information gathering**, where systems analysts identify and extract system problems and solution requirements from the user community. Several techniques are employed to achieve this, as highlighted in the course outline and other materials.

Here are detailed notes on the mentioned information gathering techniques:

**1. Interviews:**

- Interviews are a primary fact-finding technique used to collect information about system problems, opportunities, solution requirements, and priorities.
- During the system analysis phase of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), in-depth studies of the existing system are conducted, and interviews are used to expand on data gathered in the preliminary investigation.
- Analysts conduct interviews to determine what information is needed by whom, when, where, and why.
- Client interviews are also mentioned as a way to build a real-world model of requirements in object-oriented analysis.

**2. Joint Application Design (JAD):**

- Joint Application Design (JAD) is a requirements gathering technique mentioned in the course outline.
- Joint requirements planning (JRP) techniques are described as using facilitated workshops to bring together all system owners, system users, systems analysts, and some system designers and builders to jointly perform systems analysis. This appears to be synonymous with or closely related to JAD.

**3. Questionnaires:**

- Questionnaires are listed as an information gathering technique in the course outline and as a fact-finding technique.
- These are used to collect information about system problems, opportunities, solution requirements, and priorities from a larger audience compared to interviews.

**4. Document Analysis:**

- Document analysis is another technique mentioned for requirements determination.
- During system analysis, examining formal lines of authority (organization charts), standard operating procedures, and how information flows within the existing system are crucial aspects of document analysis.
- Analyzing existing documentation helps in understanding the current system and identifying inefficiencies.

**5. Observation:**

- Observation is a direct method of gathering information about how the current system operates.
- By observing processes and user interactions, analysts can gain firsthand understanding of the system's functionalities and potential issues.
- Observation helps in defining the problem by seeing what information is needed, by whom, when, where, and why.

**6. Rapid Application Development (RAD):**

- Rapid Application Development (RAD) is mentioned as an information gathering technique.
- Accelerated analysis approaches, such as RAD, emphasize the construction of prototypes to more rapidly identify business and user requirements for a new system.
- Discovery prototyping, sometimes called requirements prototyping, is a key aspect of such accelerated methods. It involves creating a quick-and-dirty implementation of requirements for users to react to, thereby identifying their needs.
- CASE tools can also support Rapid Application Development (RAD) by automating costly and slow documentation tasks.

In addition to these specific techniques, the sources highlight the importance of:

- **Understanding the existing system:** Thoroughly understanding the old system is necessary before planning a new one.
- **Identifying requirements:** The system analysis phase focuses on studying and structuring system requirements. This includes defining what the new system should do from the user's perspective. Requirements for the new system should cover the subject, scope, objectives, benefits, and a possible development schedule.
- **Using models:** Model-driven analysis emphasizes drawing pictorial system models (like data flow diagrams and UML diagrams) to document and validate both existing and proposed systems. These models become blueprints for designing and constructing an improved system.
- **Fact-finding:** This classical set of techniques, including sampling and research in addition to interviews, questionnaires, and observation, is used to collect information.
- **Defining functional and nonfunctional requirements:** A functional requirement describes the activities and services a system must provide, while a nonfunctional requirement describes other features, characteristics, and constraints of a satisfactory system.

The information gathered through these techniques forms the foundation for the subsequent **systems design** phase, where a new or alternative system is planned.
