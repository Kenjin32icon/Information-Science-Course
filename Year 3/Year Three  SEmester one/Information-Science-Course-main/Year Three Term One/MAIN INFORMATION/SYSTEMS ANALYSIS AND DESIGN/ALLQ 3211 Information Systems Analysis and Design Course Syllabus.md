## ALLQ 3211 Information Systems Analysis and Design Course Syllabus

currently a relative who is staff huku KU ana ni host
From all our discussions na hisi kama nakujua surface level 
like  you are a dark soul who loves crime shows, anime and manga that are kinda questionable, kinda
From all our discussion i some how know who you are on the outside
Na it might be weird to invite me
