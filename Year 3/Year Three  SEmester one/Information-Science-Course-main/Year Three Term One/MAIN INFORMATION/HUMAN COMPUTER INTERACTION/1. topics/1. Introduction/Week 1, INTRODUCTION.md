This week provides a foundational understanding of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), including defining key terms and exploring the core concepts of the field.

**Definition of Terms**

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):**
    - HCI, alternatively known as Man-Machine Interaction (MMI) or Computer-Human Interaction (CHI), is the **study of the interaction between people (users) and computers (machines)**.
    - It is an **interdisciplinary field** focused on the **design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use**.
    - HCI also studies the **major phenomena surrounding the use of interactive computing systems**.
    - It encompasses a broad range of disciplines including **computer science, psychology, [[ergonomics]], engineering, and graphic design**.
    - The field focuses on creating **interfaces and systems that are intuitive, efficient, and effective for users**.
- **User:** A person who interacts with a computer system to perform tasks and achieve goals. Users come from diverse backgrounds with different technical skills and cognitive abilities.
- **Computer System (Interactive Computer System or System):** The **combination of hardware and software components that receive input from, and communicate output to, a user in order to support his or her performance of a task**. This can include personal computers (PCs) as well as embedded systems.
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - The **part of the computer system with which a user interacts** in order to undertake tasks and achieve goals.
    - It is the **graphical, textual, and auditory information the program presents to the user**.
    - The UI also includes the **control sequences (such as keystrokes, mouse movements, or touchscreen selections) the user employs to control the program**.
    - For users, the interface often _is_ the system. The user's view of a computer system is often limited to and based solely on their experience of the user interface.
    - The UI has essentially two components: **input** (how the user communicates to the computer) and **output** (how the computer conveys results to the user).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    - A **type of user interface using graphics for interaction with a computer**.
    - It employs **graphical images, widgets, along with text to represent the information and actions available to a user**.
    - Users typically control the program by **moving a pointer on the screen (usually with a mouse) and selecting objects by pressing buttons**.
- **Usability:**
    - The **extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use**.
    - **Effectiveness:** The accuracy and completeness with which specified users can achieve specified goals.
    - **Efficiency:** The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness of the goals achieved.
    - **Satisfaction:** The comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its use.
- **User Experience (UX):** The **overall feeling users have when interacting with a system**. A positive UX means the system is easy to use, intuitive, and meets the user’s needs.

**Understanding Human Computer Interaction**

- **Goal of HCI:**
    - A basic goal of HCI is **to improve the interactions between users and computers by making computers more usable and receptive to the user's needs**.
    - A long-term goal is **to design systems that minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they want to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's task**.
    - Ultimately, HCI aims to make technology **user-friendly, accessible, and effective**, ensuring that people can interact with computers in a way that feels natural, enhances productivity, and improves the overall user experience.
- **Importance of HCI:**
    - **User-centered design is getting a crucial role** in software development.
    - It is increasingly important for organizations to **increase competitiveness via HCI studies**.
    - Badly designed products and services lead to **users losing time** and even **giving up using bad interfaces**, resulting in an ineffective allocation of resources.
    - Good user interface design can lead to **higher staff productivity, lower staff turnover, higher staff morale, and higher job satisfaction** for businesses.
    - Usable systems require **less training**, saving employers money.
    - HCI **enhances user experience (UX)** by making technology easier to use, reducing frustration and increasing user satisfaction.
    - Well-designed systems **increase productivity** by allowing users to complete tasks faster and with minimal effort.
    - HCI **promotes accessibility and inclusivity** by ensuring systems are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.
    - HCI **supports innovation** by driving the development of new and creative forms of interaction.
    - By designing simple and intuitive systems, HCI **reduces cognitive load**, allowing users to focus on their tasks.
    - In safety-critical fields, HCI plays a critical role in **improving safety** and reducing errors.
    - HCI **bridges the gap between humans and technology**, making interactions more natural and seamless.
- **User-Centered Design (UCD) in HCI:**
    - UCD is a **core principle of HCI**, focusing on designing systems with the user’s needs and goals at the forefront.
    - It involves understanding the **users' behavior, preferences, and challenges** to create better technology solutions.
    - UCD is an **approach to user interface design and development that involves users throughout the design and development process**.
    - It requires an understanding of the **tasks that users will perform** with the system and the **environment (organizational, social, and physical) in which they will use the system**.
    - Adopting a user-centered design approach should **optimize a computer system’s usability**.
- **Evolution of HCI Focus:**
    - Initially focused on making computers usable for **experts or professionals**.
    - As computers became part of daily life, the focus shifted to designing systems that are **easy to use for a broader range of people**, from novices to experienced users.
    - HCI now encompasses diverse technologies, including **mobile devices, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), wearable devices, and smart systems**.
- **Key Components of HCI:** The field considers the interplay between:
    - **The User:** Understanding their characteristics, behavior, and overall experience.
    - **The Interface:** Designing effective input and output devices, user interface elements, and interaction modes.
    - **The Task:** Analyzing user goals and ensuring the system supports task completion.
    - **Usability:** Ensuring learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, and satisfaction.
    - **Context of Use:** Considering environmental, social, and cultural factors.
    - **Feedback:** Providing timely and clear system responses to user actions.
    - **Ergonomics:** Focusing on the physical interaction and user comfort.
    - **Cognitive Aspects:** Minimizing cognitive load and aligning with user mental models.
    - **Accessibility:** Designing for all users, including those with disabilities.
    - **Interaction Techniques:** Utilizing appropriate methods like direct manipulation or natural user interfaces.
    - **Evaluation and Testing:** Continuously assessing and improving the design based on user feedback.
    - **Ethics in HCI:** Addressing privacy, security, and broader societal implications.
- **Challenges in HCI:**
    - **Adapting to Emerging Technologies:** HCI principles must evolve with new forms of interaction.
    - **Balancing Complexity and Simplicity:** Creating powerful yet easy-to-use systems.
    - **Cultural Differences:** Designing systems for global audiences, considering varying preferences.
- **Future of HCI:** Likely to involve more **natural, seamless interactions** through gesture-based interfaces, voice control, brain-computer interfaces, and smart environments.
