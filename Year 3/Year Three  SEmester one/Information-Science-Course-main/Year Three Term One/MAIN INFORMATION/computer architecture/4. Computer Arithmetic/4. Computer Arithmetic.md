### Computer Arithmetic Summary Notes

**Binary Over Decimal**

- Computers use [[binary]] numbers (0 and 1) instead of decimal numbers because electrical components operate in binary mode (on or off).
- The binary system simplifies internal circuit design, making circuits less expensive and more reliable.

**[[Binary Arithmetic operations]]**

- **Binary Addition**
    - 0 + 0 = 0
    - 0 + 1 = 1
    - 1 + 0 = 1
    - 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry of 1 to the next column)
- **Binary Subtraction**
    - 0 - 0 = 0
    - 0 - 1 = 1 (with a borrow from the next column)
    - 1 - 0 = 1
    - 1 - 1 = 0
- **Complementary Subtraction**
    1. Find the complement of the subtrahend.
    2. Add the complement to the minuend.
    3. If there's a carry of 1, add it to the sum. If there's no carry, re complement the sum and add a negative sign.
- **Binary Multiplication**
    - 0 x 0 = 0
    - 0 x 1 = 0
    - 1 x 0 = 0
    - 1 x 1 = 1
- **Binary Division**
    - 0 รท 0 = Divide by zero error
    - 0 รท 1 = 0
    - 1 รท 0 = Divide by zero error
    - 1 รท 1 = 1
- **Additive Method of Multiplication and Division**
    - Most computers use the additive method for multiplication and division because it simplifies internal circuit design.
    - Multiplication: Repeated addition (e.g., 4 x 8 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32).
    - Division: Repeated subtraction (see rules below).

**Rules for Additive Method of Division**

1. Repeatedly subtract the divisor from the dividend until the result is less than or equal to zero.
2. If the result is zero:
    - Quotient = number of subtractions performed.
    - Remainder = 0
3. If the result is less than zero:
    - Quotient = number of subtractions performed - 1.
    - Remainder = result of the subtraction before the last one.

**Complement of a Number**

- Formula: Complement (C) = (Base)^n - 1 - N, where n is the number of digits and N is the number.
- For binary numbers, the complement is obtained by switching all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s.
