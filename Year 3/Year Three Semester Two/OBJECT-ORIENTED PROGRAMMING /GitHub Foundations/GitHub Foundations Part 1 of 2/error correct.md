g**Understanding the Error**

- The error message indicates that your push to the remote repository was rejected.
- This typically happens when there are changes in the remote repository that you do not have in your local repository.

**Steps to Resolve the Issue**

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes**
   - First, you need to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to see what has been updated.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Merge or Rebase the Changes**
   - You can either merge or rebase the changes into your local branch. Here are the commands for both:

   - **Merge:**
   ```bash
   git merge origin/master
   ```

   - **Rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/master
   ```

3. **Resolve Any Conflicts**
   - If there are any merge conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually. After resolving, make sure to add the changes:
   ```bash
   git add <file_with_conflicts>
   ```

4. **Complete the Merge or Rebase**
   - If you merged, you can complete the merge with:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

   - If you rebased, you can continue the rebase with:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Push Your Changes Again**
   - After successfully merging or rebasing, you can push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

**Additional Notes**

- If you are sure that you want to overwrite the remote changes (not recommended unless you know what you're doing), you can force push:
```bash
git push origin master --force
```
- Be cautious with force pushing as it can overwrite changes made by others.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully push your changes to the remote repository.
