Discussion Questions 

NB: Instructions: Please discuss these questions. The answers to these questions are important as they form the basis for the next chapters.

    i. Why is it important to understand the difference between hubs, switches, and routers when designing a network?


    ii. How do MAC addresses and IP addresses work together to ensure data is sent to the correct destination?
    iii. What could happen if IP addressing is misconfigured in a network?
    iv. Discuss a real-world scenario where choosing the wrong type of network device (e.g., using a hub instead of a switch) could lead to performance or security issues.
    v. Why is the OSI model considered essential for understanding network communication even though it's theoretical?
    vi. Which OSI layer do you think is the most vulnerable to security threats and why?
    vii. How does encapsulation work across the OSI layers, and why is it important in data transmission?
    viii. Can you give a practical example of how a problem at one layer (e.g., the Data Link layer) might affect the functioning of higher layers?
    ix. In modern networking, how do protocols like TCP and UDP illustrate the differences between the Transport and Network layers?
